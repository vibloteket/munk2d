## Intro

Chipmunk2D is a 2D rigid body physics library distributed under the MIT license.
It is blazingly fast, portable, numerically stable, and easy to use. For this
reason it has been used in hundreds of games across just about every system you
can name. This includes top quality titles such as Night Sky for the Wii and
many #1 sellers on the iPhone App Store! I've put thousands of hours of work
over many years to make Chipmunk2D what it is today. If you find Chipmunk2D has
saved you a lot of time, please consider
[donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6666552).
You'll make an indie game developer very happy!

First of all, I would like to give Erin Catto a big thank you, as Chipmunk2D's
impulse solver was directly inspired by his example code way back in 2006. (Now
a full-fledged physics engine all its own: [Box2D.org](http://www.box2d.org/)).
His contact persistence idea allows for stable stacks of objects with very few
iterations of the solver. My previous solver produced mushy piles of objects or
required a large amount of CPU to operate stably.

### Why a C Library?

A lot of people ask me why I wrote Chipmunk2D in C instead of _pick your
favorite language here_. I tend to get really excited about different
programming languages. Depending on the month, take your pick of Scheme, OCaml,
Ruby, Objective-C, ooc, Lua, Io... the list goes on. The one common factor
between almost any language is that they are usually dead simple to make
bindings to C code. I also wanted Chipmunk2D to be fast, portable, easy to
optimize and easy to debug. Writing Chipmunk2D in C made it simpler to achieve
all of those goals.

That said, I've never developed a whole game in C and I probably never will.
There are much more interesting and fun languages than C with all sorts of nice
features like garbage collection, closures and all sorts of unique
object-oriented runtimes. Check out the
[Bindings and Ports](http://chipmunk2d.net/bindingsAndPorts.php) page to see if
you can use Chipmunk2D from your language of choice. Because Chipmunk2D is
written in a subset of C99 it compiles cleanly as C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++ code, making it easy to integrate into projects in those
languages.

### Limitations of a C API

Chipmunk does provide overloaded operators for `*`, `+`, and `-` (unary and
binary) if you are using C++, but falls back to using functions such as
`cpvadd()` and `cpvsub()` for C code. This is a little harder to read, but works
OK once you get used to it. Most of the interesting vector operations that are
possible don't have a symbol for them anyway (at least not on a keyboard).

Another problem for a C API is access restriction. There are many structs,
fields and functions in Chipmunk that are only meant to be used internally. To
work around this, I have a separate header full of Chipmunk's private API,
`chipmunk_private.h`. I also use a macro, `CP_PRIVATE()` to mangle names in
public structures. While you can feel free to include this header or use the
macro in your own code to access the private API, be aware that the fields and
functions may be renamed or disappear without warning and I have no plans to
document or support usage of the private API.

## Get it, Compile it

If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can always download the newest version of
Chipmunk2D [here](http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest.tgz).
Inside you'll find a command line build script that works with
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), a XCode project and project files for Visual
Studio '09 and '10.

#### Debug or Release?

Debug mode might be slightly slower, but will include a lot of error checking
assertions that can help you find bugs quicker such as removing objects twice or
doing things that might cause unsolvable collisions. I highly recommend you use
a debug build until you are ready to ship the game and only then switch to a
release build.

#### XCode (Mac/iPhone)

The included XCode project has targets for building a static library for the Mac
or iOS. Additionally, you might want to just run the
`xcode/iphonestatic.command` or `xcode/macstatic.command` to build you a
directory with the headers and debug/release static libraries that you can just
drop right into your projects. Including Chipmunk in your project with all the
correct compiler flags applied couldn't be simpler. The iPhone script generates
a "fat" library that can be used with both the iOS simulator and devices. The
device version is compiled as release, and the simulator version is compiled as
debug.

#### MSVC

I rarely use MSVC, but others have chipped in to help me maintain Visual Studio
project files. The MSVC 10 project should work, as I usually remember to test
that before making a stable release. The MSVC 9 project may not as I don't have
access to that version. Let me know if there are any issues.

#### Command Line

The CMake build script should work on any system (Unix/Win/Mac) as long as you
have CMake installed. It can even generate XCode or MSVC projects if you want
(see CMake's documentation for more information).

To compile a Chipmunk debug build on the command line, all you need to do is
run:

```c
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
    make
```

If the `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` option is left out, it will make a release
build instead.

Why CMake? Somebody was kind enough to create the build scripts for me
originally, and it seems to handle a lot of the cross-platform issues nicely. I
know some people really hate having to install some random non-make build system
in order to compile things, but it has saved me a lot of time and effort.

### Hello Chipmunk (World)

Hello world Chipmunk style. Create a simple simulation where a ball falls onto a
static line segment, then rolls off. Print out the coordinates of the ball.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <chipmunk.h>

int main(void){
  // cpVect is a 2D vector and cpv() is a shortcut for initializing them.
  cpVect gravity = cpv(0, -100);

  // Create an empty space.
  cpSpace *space = cpSpaceNew();
  cpSpaceSetGravity(space, gravity);

  // Add a static line segment shape for the ground.
  // We'll make it slightly tilted so the ball will roll off.
  // We attach it to a static body to tell Chipmunk it shouldn't be movable.
  cpShape *ground = cpSegmentShapeNew(cpSpaceGetStaticBody(space), cpv(-20, 5), cpv(20, -5), 0);
  cpShapeSetFriction(ground, 1);
  cpSpaceAddShape(space, ground);

  // Now let's make a ball that falls onto the line and rolls off.
  // First we need to make a cpBody to hold the physical properties of the object.
  // These include the mass, position, velocity, angle, etc. of the object.
  // Then we attach collision shapes to the cpBody to give it a size and shape.

  cpFloat radius = 5;
  cpFloat mass = 1;

  // The moment of inertia is like mass for rotation
  // Use the cpMomentFor*() functions to help you approximate it.
  cpFloat moment = cpMomentForCircle(mass, 0, radius, cpvzero);

  // The cpSpaceAdd*() functions return the thing that you are adding.
  // It's convenient to create and add an object in one line.
  cpBody *ballBody = cpSpaceAddBody(space, cpBodyNew(mass, moment));
  cpBodySetPosition(ballBody, cpv(0, 15));

  // Now we create the collision shape for the ball.
  // You can create multiple collision shapes that point to the same body.
  // They will all be attached to the body and move around to follow it.
  cpShape *ballShape = cpSpaceAddShape(space, cpCircleShapeNew(ballBody, radius, cpvzero));
  cpShapeSetFriction(ballShape, 0.7);

  // Now that it's all set up, we simulate all the objects in the space by
  // stepping forward through time in small increments called steps.
  // It is *highly* recommended to use a fixed size time step.
  cpFloat timeStep = 1.0/60.0;
  for(cpFloat time = 0; time < 2; time += timeStep){
    cpVect pos = cpBodyGetPosition(ballBody);
    cpVect vel = cpBodyGetVelocity(ballBody);
    printf(
      "Time is %5.2f. ballBody is at (%5.2f, %5.2f). It's velocity is (%5.2f, %5.2f)\n",
      time, pos.x, pos.y, vel.x, vel.y
    );

    cpSpaceStep(space, timeStep);
  }

  // Clean up our objects and exit!
  cpShapeFree(ballShape);
  cpBodyFree(ballBody);
  cpShapeFree(ground);
  cpSpaceFree(space);

  return 0;
}
```

## Chipmunk2D Basics

### Overview

There are 4 basic object types you will use in Chipmunk.

- **Rigid Bodies:** A rigid body holds the physical properties of an object.
  (mass, position, rotation, velocity, etc.) It does not have a shape until you
  attach one or more collision shapes to it. If you've done physics with
  particles before, rigid bodies differ in that they are able to rotate. Rigid
  bodies generally tend to have a 1:1 correlation to sprites in a game. You
  should structure your game so that you use the position and rotation of the
  rigid body for drawing your sprite.
- **Collision Shapes:** By attaching shapes to bodies, you can define the a
  body's shape. You can attach as many shapes to a single body as you need to in
  order to define a complex shape. Shapes contain the surface properties of an
  object such as how much friction or elasticity it has.
- **Constraints/Joints:** Constraints and joints describe how bodies are
  attached to each other.
- **Spaces:** Spaces are containers for simulating objects in Chipmunk. You add
  bodies, shapes and joints to a space and then update the space as a whole.
  They control how all the rigid bodies, shapes, and constraints interact
  together.

There is often confusion between rigid bodies and their collision shapes in
Chipmunk and how they relate to sprites. A sprite would be a visual
representation of an object, while a collision shape is an invisible property
that defines how objects should collide. Both the sprite's and the collision
shape's position and rotation are controlled by the motion of a rigid body.
Generally you want to create a game object type that ties these things all
together.

### Memory Management the Chipmunk way

For most of the structures you will use, Chipmunk uses a more or less standard
and straightforward set of memory management functions. Take the
[cpSpace](#cpSpace) struct for example:

- `cpSpaceNew()` - Allocates and initializes a `cpSpace` struct. It calls
  `cpSpaceAlloc()` then `cpSpaceInit()`.
- `cpSpaceFree(cpSpace *space)` - Destroys and frees the `cpSpace` struct.

You are responsible for freeing any structs that you allocate. Chipmunk does not
do reference counting or garbage collection. If you call a `new` function, you
must call the matching `free` function or you will leak memory.

Additionally if you need more control over allocation and initialization because
you are allocating temporary structs on the stack, writting a language binding,
or working in a low memory environment you can also use the following functions.
_Most people will never have any need to use these functions._

- `cpSpaceAlloc()` - Allocates but does not initialize a `cpSpace` struct. All
  allocation functions look more or less like this:
  `return (cpSpace *)cpcalloc(1, sizeof(cpSpace));` You can write your own
  allocation functions if you want. It is not a requirement that the memory be
  zeroed.
- `cpSpaceInit(cpSpace *space)` - Initializes a `cpSpace` struct.
- `cpSpaceDestroy(cpSpace *space)` - Frees all memory allocated by
  `cpSpaceInit()`, but does not free the `cpSpace` struct itself.

Like calls to the `new` and `free` functions. Any memory allocated by an `alloc`
function must be freed by `cpfree()` or similar. Any call to an `init` function
must be matched with its `destroy` function.

To further ease integration with garbage collectors or other memory management
constraints, Chipmunk has a number of compile time defines (`cpcalloc()`,
`cprealloc()`, and `cpfree()`) that can be overriden. If you aren't using
Chipmunk from a garbage collected language, I'd highly recommend using libGC. It
provides nearly transparent garbage collection for C based languages.

### Basic Types

`chipmunk_types.h` defines a number of basic types that Chipmunk uses. These can
be changed at compile time to better suit your needs:

- `cpFloat`: Floating point type. Defaults to `double`.
- `cpVect`: 2D vector type. [cpVect documentation](#cpVect)
- `cpBool`: Like every good C library that wants good cross language
  compatibility, you end up defining your own boolean type. :-\\ Defaults to
  `int`.
- `cpDataPointer`: Pointer type defined for callbacks and the user definable
  data pointer on most Chipmunk structs. Defaults to `void*`.
- `cpCollisionType`: Unique identifier for collision shape types. Defaults to
  `unsigned int`. Defined type must support the `==` operator.
- `cpGroup`: Unique identifier for collision groups. Defaults to `unsigned int`.
  A `CP_NO_GROUP` value is defined that can be used when you don't want to
  specify a group. Defined type must support the equality `==` operator.
- `cpBitmask`: Type used for collision filter categories and masks. Defaults to
  `unsigned int`. Defined type must support the bitwise AND `&` operator.
- `cpTransform`: Type used for 2x3 affine transforms in Chipmunk.

If you are writting a game engine or language binding on top of Chipmunk, you
might want to choose to use object references instead of integers for collision
type and group. I often use class pointers for collision types and game object
pointers for groups. It's much simpler than keeping a table of enumerations
around.

**Note:** On the iPhone, `cpFloat` is defined as `float` and `cpVect` is an
alias for `CGPoint` for performance and compatibility reasons.

### Math the Chipmunk way

First of all, Chipmunk uses double precision floating point numbers throughout
its calculations by default. This is likely to be faster on most modern desktop
processors, and means you don't have to worry as much about floating point
accuracy. You can change the floating point type used by Chipmunk when compiling
the library. Look in `chipmunk_types.h`.

Chipmunk defines a number of aliases for common math functions so that you can
choose to use floats or doubles for Chipmunk's floating point type. In your own
code, there probably isn't a strong reason to use these aliases unless you
expect you might want to change Chipmunk's floating point type later and a 2%
performance hit from using the wrong float/double version of math functions will
matter.

However, there are a few unique functions you will probably find very useful:

- `cpFloat cpfclamp(cpFloat f, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)` - Clamp `f` to be
  between `min` and `max`.
- `cpFloat cpflerp(cpFloat f1, cpFloat f2, cpFloat t)` - Linearly interpolate
  between `f1` and `f2`.
- `cpFloat cpflerpconst(cpFloat f1, cpFloat f2, cpFloat d)` - Linearly
  interpolate from `f1` towards `f2` by no more than `d`.

Floating point infinity is defined as `INFINITY`. This is defined by many math
libraries, but is not actually part of the C standard library.

## Chipmunk Vectors: `cpVect`

### Struct Definition, Constants and Constructors

```c
typedef struct cpVect{
    cpFloat x, y;
} cpVect
```

2D vector packed into a struct. No surprises here.

```c
    static const cpVect cpvzero = {0.0f,0.0f};
```

Constant for the zero vector.

```c
cpVect cpv(const cpFloat x, const cpFloat y)
```

Convenience constructor for creating new `cpVect` structs.

### Operations

  equal. Chipmunk provides an overloaded `==` operator when used in C++
  programs. (_Be careful when comparing floating point numbers_)
- `cpVect cpvadd(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - Add two vectors. Chipmunk
  provides an overloaded `+` operator when used in C++ programs.
- `cpVect cpvsub(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - Subtract two vectors.
  Chipmunk provides an overloaded `-` operator when used in C++ programs.
- `cpVect cpvneg(const cpVect v)` - Negate a vector. Chipmunk provides an
  overloaded unary negation operator `-` when used in C++ programs.
- `cpVect cpvmult(const cpVect v, const cpFloat s)` - Scalar multiplication.
  Chipmunk provides an overloaded `*` operator when used in C++ programs.
- `cpFloat cpvdot(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - Vector dot product.
- `cpFloat cpvcross(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - 2D vector cross product
  analog. The cross product of 2D vectors results in a 3D vector with only a z
  component. This function returns the value along the z-axis.

  projection of `v1` onto `v2`.
- `cpVect cpvrotate(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - Uses complex

  `cpvrotate()`.
- `cpFloat cpvlength(const cpVect v)` - Returns the length of `v`.
- `cpFloat cpvlengthsq(const cpVect v)` - Returns the squared length of `v`.
  Faster than `cpvlength()` when you only need to compare lengths.
- `cpVect cpvlerp(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2, const cpFloat t)` - Linearly
  interpolate between `v1` and `v2`.
- `cpVect cpvlerpconst(cpVect v1, cpVect v2, cpFloat d)` - Linearly interpolate

  Spherical linearly interpolate between `v1` towards `v2` by no more than angle
  `a` in radians.
- `cpVect cpvnormalize(const cpVect v)` - Returns a normalized copy of `v`. As a
  special case, it returns `cpvzero` when called on `cpvzero`.
- `cpVect cpvclamp(const cpVect v, const cpFloat len)` - Clamp `v` to length
  `len`.

  between `v1` and `v2`.
- `cpFloat cpvdistsq(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2)` - Returns the squared
  distance between `v1` and `v2`. Faster than `cpvdist()` when you only need to
  compare distances.
- `cpBool cpvnear(const cpVect v1, const cpVect v2, const cpFloat dist)` -
  Returns true if the distance between `v1` and `v2` is less than `dist`.

  given angle (in radians).
- `cpFloat cpvtoangle(const cpVect v)` - Returns the angular direction `v` is
  pointing in (in radians).

```

Simple bounding box struct. Stored as left, bottom, right, top values.

```c
cpBB cpBBNew(const cpFloat l, const cpFloat b, const cpFloat r, const cpFloat t)
```

Convenience constructor for `cpBB` structs. Like `cpv()` this function returns a
copy and not a malloced pointer.

```c

```

Convenience constructor for making a `cpBB` fitting with a center point and half
width and height.

  the segment defined by endpoints `a` and `b` intersect `bb`.
- `cpVect cpBBClampVect(const cpBB bb, const cpVect v)` - Returns a copy of `v`
  clamped to the bounding box.
- `cpVect cpBBWrapVect(const cpBB bb, const cpVect v)` - Returns a copy of `v`
  wrapped to the bounding box.

## Rigid Bodies: `cpBody`

### Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static Bodies {#BodyTypes}

Chipmunk supports three different types of bodies with unique behavioral and
performance characteristics.

Dynamic bodies are the default body type. They react to collisions, are affected
by forces and gravity, and have a finite amount of mass. These are the type of
bodies that you want the physics engine to simulate for you. Dynamic bodies
interact with all types of bodies and can generate collision callbacks.

Kinematic bodies are bodies that are controlled from your code instead of inside
the physics engine. They aren't affected by gravity, and they have an infinite
amount of mass so they don't react to collisions or forces with other bodies.
Kinematic bodies are controlled by setting their velocity, which will cause them
to move. Good examples of kinematic bodies might include things like moving
platforms. Objects that are touching or jointed to a kinematic body are never
allowed to fall asleep.

Static bodies are bodies that never (or rarely) move. Using static bodies for
things like terrain offers a big performance boost over other body types-
because Chipmunk doesn't need to check for collisions between static objects,
and it never needs to update their collision information. Additionally, because
static bodies don't move, Chipmunk knows it's safe to let objects that are
touching or jointed to them fall asleep. Generally all of your level geometry
will be attached to a static body except for things like moving platforms or
doors. Every space provide a built-in static body for your convenience. Static
bodies can be moved, but there is a performance penalty as the collision
information is recalculated. There is no penalty for having multiple static
bodies, and it can be useful for simplifying your code by allowing different
parts of your static geometry to be initialized or moved separately.

### Movement, Teleportation, and Velocity

A graphics engine only needs to know the position of an object for each frame
that its drawn. For a physics engine, this isn't enough information to calculate
a collision response. When you set the position of a body, you are effectively
asking it to teleport itself. This means that it will instantly move to its new
position instead of moving through space and time like a normal object. If you
teleport an object so that it overlaps another one, the best the physics engine
can do is to attempt to push the objects apart again since there is no
information about their movement. This generally results in very mushy looking
collisions. So instead of setting the position of an object, it's better to set
its velocity and allow the physics engine to update the position. That way it
can resolve any resulting collisions naturally since it knows how the objects
were moving. This is why kinematic bodies work the way they do. You set the
velocity, and the physics updates their position, so the two are never out of
sync.

For dynamic bodies, setting the velocity explicitly every frame can cause
problems. For example, a problem occurs when a light dynamic body (like a
person) is pressed against a heavy dynamic body (like a car), and you set
velocity of the small object so that it's pushing it into the big body. To the
physics engine, the change in velocity is the same as applying a large impulse
(a very short, very large force). Even if the velocity is low, the large force
can allow the small body to push the big body, even when it normally wouldn't be
able to. For example, a person walking into a car can overpower the car's
friction and cause it to creep along the ground slowly. Additionally, when you
set the velocity of an object that is already in contact, it can cause the two
objects to overlap by a small amount. The easiest way to avoid both of these
problems is to make smaller changes to the body's velocity, accelerating it over
a fraction of a second instead of a single frame. An even better solution is to
use constraints to move the object. For an example, look at how the Tank and
Crane demos drive their constraints and use the maximum bias and force
properties. The mouse control in the demo application works the same way.

### Memory Management Functions

```c
cpBody *cpBodyAlloc(void)
cpBody *cpBodyInit(cpBody *body, cpFloat m, cpFloat i)
cpBody *cpBodyNew(cpFloat m, cpFloat i)

cpBody *cpBodyInitKinematic(cpBody *body)
cpBody *cpBodyNewKinematic()

cpBody *cpBodyInitStatic(cpBody *body)
cpBody *cpBodyNewStatic()

void cpBodyDestroy(cpBody *body)
void cpBodyFree(cpBody *body)
```

Standard set of Chipmunk memory management functions. `m` and `i` are the mass
and moment of inertia for the body. Guessing the mass for a body is usually
fine, but guessing a moment of inertia can lead to a very poor simulation so
it's recommended to use Chipmunk's moment calculations to estimate the moment
for you. Be careful not to free a body before any shapes or constraints attached
to it have been removed from a space.

### Creating Dynamic Bodies

There are two ways to set up a dynamic body. The easiest option is to create a
body with a mass and moment of 0, and set the mass or density of each collision
shape added to the body. Chipmunk will automatically calculate the mass, moment
of inertia, and center of gravity for you. This is probably preferred in most
cases.

TODO example

The other option is to set the mass of the body when it's created, and leave the
mass of the shapes added to it as 0.0. This approach is more flexible, but is
not as easy to use. **Don't** set the mass of both the body and the shapes. If
you do so, it will recalculate and overwrite your custom mass value when the
shapes are added to the body.

### Properties

Chipmunk provides getter/setter functions for a number of properties on rigid
bodies. Setting most properties automatically wakes the rigid bodies up if they
were sleeping. You can also set the fields directly on the `cpBody` struct if
you wish. They are documented in the headers.

```c
cpBodyType cpBodyGetType(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetType(cpBody *body, cpBodyType)
```

Set the type of body (dynamic, kinematic, static). See the section on
[BodyTypes](#BodyTypes) for more information. When changing a body to a dynamic
body, the mass and moment of inertia are recalculated from the shapes added to
the body. Custom calculated moments of inertia are not preserved when changing
types. This function cannot be called directly in a collision callback. See
[Post-Step Callbacks](#PostStep) for more information.

```c
cpSpace *cpBodyGetSpace(const cpBody *body)
```

The `cpSpace` this body is currently added to, or `NULL` if it is not currently
added to a space.

```c
cpFloat cpBodyGetMass(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetMass(cpBody *body, cpFloat m)
```

Mass of the body.

```c
cpFloat cpBodyGetMoment(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetMoment(cpBody *body, cpFloat i)
```

Moment of inertia (MoI or sometimes just moment) of the body. The moment is like
the rotational mass of a body. See below for function to help calculate the
moment.

```c
cpVect cpBodyGetPosition(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetPosition(cpBody *body, cpVect pos)
```

Position of the body. When changing the position you may also want to call
`cpSpaceReindexShapesForBody()` to update the collision detection information
for the attached shapes if plan to make any queries against the space.

```c
cpVect cpBodyGetCenterOfGravity(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetCenterOfGravity(cpBody *body, cpVect cog)
```

Location of the center of gravity in body local coordinates. The default value
is `(0, 0)`, meaning the center of gravity is the same as the position of the
body.

```c
cpVect cpBodyGetVelocity(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetVelocity(cpBody *body, const cpVect value)
```

Linear velocity of the center of gravity of the body.

```c
cpVect cpBodyGetForce(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetForce(cpBody *body, const cpVect value)
```

Force applied to the center of gravity of the body. This value is reset for
every time step.

```c
cpFloat cpBodyGetAngle(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetAngle(cpBody *body, cpFloat a)
```

Rotation of the body in radians. When changing the rotation you may also want to
call `cpSpaceReindexShapesForBody()` to update the collision detection
information for the attached shapes if plan to make any queries against the
space. A body rotates around its center of gravity, not its position.

```c
cpFloat cpBodyGetAngularVelocity(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetAngularVelocity(cpBody *body, const cpFloat value)
```

The angular velocity of the body in radians per second.

```c
cpFloat cpBodyGetTorque(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetTorque(cpBody *body, const cpFloat value)
```

The torque applied to the body. This value is reset for every time step.

```c
cpVect cpBodyGetRotation(const cpBody *body)
```

The rotation vector for the body. Can be used with `cpvrotate()` or
`cpvunrotate()` to perform fast rotations.

```c
cpSpace* cpBodyGetSpace(const cpBody *body)
```

Get the `cpSpace` that `body` has been added to.

```c
cpDataPointer cpBodyGetUserData(const cpBody *body)
void cpBodySetUserData(cpBody *body, const cpDataPointer value)
```

User data pointer. Use this pointer to get a reference to the game object that
owns this body from callbacks.

### Moment of Inertia and Area Helper Functions

Use the following functions to approximate the moment of inertia for your body,
adding the results together if you want to use more than one.

- `cpFloat cpMomentForCircle(cpFloat m, cpFloat r1, cpFloat r2, cpVect offset)` -
  Calculate the moment of inertia for a hollow circle, `r1` and `r2` are the
  inner and outer diameters in no particular order. (A solid circle has an inner
  diameter of 0).
- `cpFloat cpMomentForSegment(cpFloat m, cpVect a, cpVect b, cpFloat radius)` -
  Calculate the moment of inertia for a line segment. The endpoints `a` and `b`
  are relative to the body.
- `cpFloat cpMomentForPoly(cpFloat m, int count, const cpVect *verts, cpVect offset, cpFloat radius)` -
  Calculate the moment of inertia for a solid polygon shape assuming its center
  of gravity is at its centroid. The offset is added to each vertex.
- `cpFloat cpMomentForBox(cpFloat m, cpFloat width, cpFloat height)` - Calculate
  the moment of inertia for a solid box centered on the body.

<!-- TODO poly examples -->

#### Moment Examples

Note that most of the time its more convenient to use `cpShapeSetMass` or
`cpShapeSetDensity` instead to automatically calculate the moment.

```c
// Moment for a solid circle with a mass of 2 and radius 5.
cpFloat circle1 = cpMomentForCircle(2, 0, 5, cpvzero);

// Moment for a hollow circle with a mass of 1, inner radius of 2 and outer radius of 6.
cpFloat circle2 = cpMomentForCircle(1, 2, 6, cpvzero);

// Moment for a solid circle with a mass of 1, radius of 3 and
// centered 3 units along the x axis from the center of gravity.
cpFloat circle3 = cpMomentForCircle(2, 0, 5, cpv(3, 0));

// Composite object. 1x4 box centered on the center of gravity and a circle sitting on top.
// Just add the moments together.
cpFloat composite = cpMomentForBox(boxMass, 1, 4) + cpMomentForCircle(circleMass, 0, 1, cpv(0, 3));
```

Use the following functions to get the area for common Chipmunk shapes if you
want to approximate masses or density or whatnot.

- `cpFloat cpAreaForCircle(cpFloat r1, cpFloat r2)` - Area of a hollow circle.
- `cpFloat cpAreaForSegment(cpVect a, cpVect b, cpFloat r)` - Area of a beveled
  segment. (Will always be zero if radius is zero).
- `cpFloat cpAreaForPoly(const int count, const cpVect *verts, cpFloat radius)` -
  Signed area of a polygon shape. Returns a negative number for polygons with a
  clockwise winding.

### Coordinate Conversion Functions

Many things are defined in coordinates local to a body meaning that the (0,0) is
at the center of gravity of the body and the axis rotate along with the body.

- `cpVect cpBodyLocalToWorld(const cpBody *body, const cpVect v)` - Convert from
  body local coordinates to world space coordinates.
- `cpVect cpBodyWorldToLocal(const cpBody *body, const cpVect v)` - Convert from
  world space coordinates to body local coordinates.

### Velocity Conversion Functions

It's often useful to know the absolute velocity of a point on the surface of a
body since the angular velocity affects everything except the center of gravity.

- `cpVect cpBodyVelocityAtWorldPoint(const cpBody *body, const point)` - Get the
  absolute velocity of the rigid body at the given world point `point`.
- `cpVect cpBodyVelocityAtLocalPoint(const cpBody *body, const point)` - Get the
  absolute velocity of the rigid body at the given body local point `point`.

### Applying Forces and Torques

People are sometimes confused by the difference between a force and an impulse.
An impulse is a very large force applied over a very short period of time. Some
examples are a ball hitting a wall or cannon firing. Chipmunk treats impulses as
if they occur instantaneously by adding directly to the velocity of an object.
Both impulses and forces are affected the mass of an object. Doubling the mass
of the object will halve the effect.

- `void cpBodyApplyForceAtWorldPoint(cpBody *body, const cpVect force, const cpVect point)` -
  Add the force `force` to `body` as if applied from the world point `point`.
- `void cpBodyApplyForceAtLocalPoint(cpBody *body, const cpVect force, const cpVect point)` -
  Add the local force `force` to `body` as if applied from the body local point
  `point`.
- `void cpBodyApplyImpulseAtWorldPoint(cpBody *body, const cpVect impulse, const cpVect point)` -
  Add the impulse `impulse` to `body` as if applied from the world point
  `point`.
- `void cpBodyApplyImpulseAtLocalPoint(cpBody *body, const cpVect impulse, const cpVect point)` -
  Add the local impulse `impulse` to `body` as if applied from the body local
  point `point`.

### Sleeping Functions

Chipmunk supports a sleeping feature which improves performance by not
simulating groups of objects that aren't moving. Read more about it in the
[Space section](#cpSpace-Sleeping).

- `cpBool cpBodyIsSleeping(const cpBody *body)` - Returns true if `body` is
  sleeping.
- `void cpBodyActivate(cpBody *body)` - Reset the idle timer on a body. If it
  was sleeping, wake it and any other bodies it was touching.
- `void cpBodySleep(cpBody *body)` - Forces a body to fall asleep immediately
  even if it's in midair. Cannot be called from a callback.
- `void cpBodyActivateStatic(cpBody *body, cpShape *filter)` - Similar in
  function to `cpBodyActivate()`. Activates all bodies touching `body`. If
  `filter` is not `NULL`, then only bodies touching through `filter` will be
  awoken.

```c
void cpBodySleepWithGroup(cpBody *body, cpBody *group)
```

When objects in Chipmunk sleep, they sleep as a group of all objects that are
touching or jointed together. When an object is woken up, all the objects in its
group are woken up. `cpBodySleepWithGroup()` allows you group sleeping objects
together. It acts identically to `cpBodySleep()` if you pass `NULL` as `group`
by starting a new group. If you pass a sleeping body for `group`, `body` will be
awoken when `group` is awoken. You can use this to initialize levels and start
stacks of objects in a pre-sleeping state.

#### Sleeping Example

```c
// Construct a pile of boxes.
// Force them to sleep until the first time they are touched.
// Group them together so that touching any box wakes all of them.
cpFloat size = 20;
cpFloat mass = 1;
cpFloat moment = cpMomentForBox(mass, size, size);

cpBody *lastBody = NULL;

for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
  cpBody *body = cpSpaceAddBody(space, cpBodyNew(mass, moment));
  cpBodySetPos(body, cpv(0, i*size));

  cpShape *shape = cpSpaceAddShape(space, cpBoxShapeNew(body, size, size));
  cpShapeSetFriction(shape, 0.7);

  // You can use any sleeping body as a group identifier.
  // Here we just keep a reference to the last body we initialized.
  // Passing NULL as the group starts a new sleeping group.
  // You MUST do this after completely initializing the object.
  // Attaching shapes or calling setter functions will wake the body back up.
  cpBodySleepWithGroup(body, lastBody);
  lastBody = body;
}
```

### Iterators

```c
typedef void (*cpBodyShapeIteratorFunc)(cpBody *body, cpShape *shape, void *data)
void cpBodyEachShape(cpBody *body, cpBodyShapeIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

Call `func` once for each shape that is attached to `body` and added to a space.
`data` is passed along as a context value. It is safe to remove shapes using
these callbacks.

```c
typedef void (*cpBodyConstraintIteratorFunc)(cpBody *body, cpConstraint *constraint, void *data)
void cpBodyEachConstraint(cpBody *body, cpBodyConstraintIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

Call `func` once for each constraint that is attached to `body` and added to a
space. `data` is passed along as a context value. It is safe to remove
constraints using the callbacks.

```c
typedef void (*cpBodyArbiterIteratorFunc)(cpBody *body, cpArbiter *arbiter, void *data)
void cpBodyEachArbiter(cpBody *body, cpBodyArbiterIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

This one is more interesting. Calls `func` once for each collision pair that
`body` is involved in. Calling `cpArbiterGet[Bodies|Shapes]()` or
`CP_ARBITER_GET_[BODIES|SHAPES]()` will return the body or shape for `body` as
the first argument. You can use this to check all sorts of collision information
for a body like if it's touching the ground, another particular object, how much
collision force is being applied to an object, etc. Sensor shapes and arbiters
that have been rejected by a collision handler callback or `cpArbiterIgnore()`
are not tracked by the contact graph.

**Note:** If your compiler supports blocks (such as Clang), there are an
alternate set of functions you can call. `cpBodyEachShape_b()`, etc. See
`chipmunk.h` for more information.

#### Crushing Example

```c
struct CrushingContext {
  cpFloat magnitudeSum;
  cpVect vectorSum;
};

static void
EstimateCrushingHelper(cpBody *body, cpArbiter *arb, struct CrushingContext *context)
{
  cpVect j = cpArbiterTotalImpulseWithFriction(arb);
  context->magnitudeSum += cpvlength(j);
  context->vectorSum = cpvadd(context->vectorSum, j);
}

cpFloat
EstimateCrushForce(cpBody *body, cpFloat dt)
{
  struct CrushingContext crush = {0.0f, cpvzero};
  cpBodyEachArbiter(body, (cpBodyArbiterIteratorFunc)EstimateCrushingHelper, &crush);

  // Compare the vector sum magnitude and magnitude sum to see if
  // how much the collision forces oppose one another.
  cpFloat crushForce = (crush.magnitudeSum - cpvlength(crush.vectorSum))*dt;
}
```

### Integration Callbacks

This section is a stub. For now, you can look at the Planet demo for an example
of how to use integration callbacks to implement planetary gravity.

<!-- TODO document and examples -->

### Getting a Transformation from a Rigid Body

You can quickly and easily build a transformation matrix from a Chipmunk body.
The following code is for OpenGL, but it should be trivial to modify for DirectX
or affine transforms. (Note that OpenGL matrices are column-major)

```c
cpVect pos = body->p;
cpVect rot = body->rot;

GLFloat matrix[16] = {
   rot.x, rot.y, 0.0f, 0.0f,
  -rot.y, rot.x, 0.0f, 0.0f,
   0.0f,   0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,
   pos.x, pos.y, 0.0f, 1.0f,
};

glMultMatrixf(matrix.farr);
```

## Collision Shapes: `cpShape`

There are currently 3 collision shape types:

- **Circles**: Fastest and simplest collision shape.
- **Line segments**: Meant mainly as a static shape. Can be beveled in order to
  give them a thickness.
- **Convex polygons**: Slowest, but most flexible collision shape.

You can add as many shapes to a body as you wish. That is why the two types are
separate. Combining multiple shapes gives you the flexibility to make any object
you want as well as providing different areas of the same object with different
friction, elasticity or callback values.

When creating different types of shapes, you will always be given a `cpShape*`
pointer back. This is because Chipmunk shapes are meant to be opaque types.
Think of the specific collision types such as `cpCircleShape`, `cpSegmentShape`
and `cpPolyShape` as private subclasses of `cpShape`. You can still read some
properties from them using the getter functions, but you are not intended to
cast `cpShape` pointers to their specific types.

### Properties

Chipmunk provides getter/setter functions for a number of properties on
collision shapes. Setting most properties will automatically wake the attached
rigid body, if it's sleeping. You can also set some of the fields directly on
the `cpShape` struct if you wish. They are documented in the headers.

```c
cpBody * cpShapeGetBody(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetBody(cpShape *shape, cpBody *body)
```

The rigid body the shape is attached to. Can only be set when the shape is not
added to a space.

```c
cpBB cpShapeGetBB(const cpShape *shape)
```

The bounding box of the shape. Only guaranteed to be valid after
`cpShapeCacheBB()` or `cpSpaceStep()` is called. Moving a body that a shape is
connected to does not update its bounding box. For shapes used for queries that
aren't attached to bodies, you can also use `cpShapeUpdate()`.

```c
cpBool cpShapeGetSensor(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetSensor(cpShape *shape, cpBool value)
```

A boolean value if this shape is a sensor or not. Sensors only call collision
callbacks, and never generate real collisions.

```c
cpFloat cpShapeGetElasticity(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetElasticity(cpShape *shape, cpFloat value)
```

Elasticity of the shape. A value of 0.0 gives no bounce, while a value of 1.0
will give a "perfect" bounce. However due to inaccuracies in the simulation
using 1.0 or greater is not recommended however. The elasticity for a collision
is found by multiplying the elasticity of the individual shapes together.

```c
cpFloat cpShapeGetFriction(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetFriction(cpShape *shape, cpFloat value)
```

Friction coefficient. Chipmunk uses the Coulomb friction model, a value of 0.0
is frictionless. The friction for a collision is found by multiplying the
friction of the individual shapes together.
[Tables of friction coefficients](http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Tribology/co_of_frict.htm).

```c
cpVect cpShapeGetSurfaceVelocity(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetSurfaceVelocity(cpShape *shape, cpVect value)
```

The surface velocity of the object. Useful for creating conveyor belts or
players that move around. This value is only used when calculating friction, not
resolving the collision.

```c
cpCollisionType cpShapeGetCollisionType(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetCollisionType(cpShape *shape, cpCollisionType value)
```

You can assign types to Chipmunk collision shapes that trigger callbacks when
objects of certain types touch. See the [callbacks section](#Callbacks-Handlers)
for more information.

```c
cpShapeFilter cpShapeGetFilter(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetFilter(cpShape *shape, cpShapeFilter filter)
```

Set the collision filter for this shape. See [Filtering Collisions](#Filtering)
for more information.

```c
cpSpace* cpShapeGetSpace(const cpShape *shape)
```

Get the `cpSpace` that `shape` has been added to.

```c
cpDataPointer cpShapeGetUserData(const cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeSetUserData(cpShape *shape, cpDataPointer value)
```

A user definable data pointer. If you set this to point at the game object the
shapes is for, then you can access your game object from Chipmunk callbacks.

### Fast Collision Filtering using cpShapeFilter

Chipmunk has two primary means of ignoring collisions: groups and category
masks.

**Groups** are used to ignore collisions between parts on a complex object. A
ragdoll is a good example. When jointing an arm onto the torso, you'll want them
to allow them to overlap. Groups allow you to do exactly that. Shapes that have
the same group don't generate collisions. So by placing all of the shapes in a
ragdoll in the same group, you'll prevent it from colliding against other parts
of itself.

**Category masks** allow you to mark which categories an object belongs to and
which categories it collidies with.

For example, a game has four collision categories: player (0), enemy (1), player
bullet (2), and enemy bullet (3). Neither players nor enemies should not collide
with their own bullets, and bullets should not collide with other bullets.
However, players collide with enemy bullets, and enemies collide with player
bullets.

| Object          | Object Category | Category Mask |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| "Player"        | 1               | 4, 5          |
| "Enemy"         | 2               | 2, 3, 5       |
| "Player Bullet" | 3               | 1, 5          |
| "Enemy Bullet"  | 4               | 2, 5          |
| "Walls"         | 5               | 1, 2, 3, 4    |

Note that everything in this example collides with walls. Additionally, the
enemies collide with each other.

By default, objects exist in every category and collide with every category.

Objects can fall into multiple categories. For instance, you might have a
category for a red team, and have a red player bullet. In the above example,
each object only has one category. If you make use of multiple categories on an
object, you may also wish to consider replacing the `cpShapeFilter` struct and
the `cpShapeFilterReject()` function in `chipmunk_private.h` to customize it to
better suit your game's needs.

The default type of `categories` and `mask` in `cpShapeFilter` is `unsigned int`
which has a resolution of 32 bits on most systems. You can redefine `cpBitmask`
in `chipmunk_types.h` if you need more bits to work with.

There is one last way of filtering collisions using collision handlers. See the
[section on callbacks](#Callbacks) for more information. Collision handlers can
be more flexible, but can be slower. Fast collision filtering rejects collisions
before running the expensive collision detection code, so using groups or
category masks is preferred.

### Memory Management Functions

```c
void cpShapeDestroy(cpShape *shape)
void cpShapeFree(cpShape *shape)
```

`Destroy` and `Free` functions are shared by all shape types. Allocation and
initialization functions are specific to each shape type. See below.

### Misc Functions

- `cpBB cpShapeCacheBB(cpShape *shape)` - Synchronizes `shape` with the body it
  is attached to.
- `cpBB cpShapeUpdate(cpShape *shape, cpVect pos, cpVect rot)` - Sets the
  position and rotation of the shape to

### Working With Circle Shapes

```c
cpCircleShape *cpCircleShapeAlloc(void)
cpCircleShape *cpCircleShapeInit(cpCircleShape *circle, cpBody *body, cpFloat radius, cpVect offset)
cpShape *cpCircleShapeNew(cpBody *body, cpFloat radius, cpVect offset)
```

`body` is the body to attach the circle to, `offset` is the offset from the
body's center of gravity in body local coordinates.

```c
cpVect cpCircleShapeGetOffset(cpShape *circleShape)
cpFloat cpCircleShapeGetRadius(cpShape *circleShape)
```

Getters for circle shape properties. Passing as non-circle shape will throw an
assertion.

### Working With Segment Shapes

```c
cpSegmentShape* cpSegmentShapeAlloc(void)
cpSegmentShape* cpSegmentShapeInit(cpSegmentShape *seg, cpBody *body, cpVect a, cpVect b, cpFloat radius)
cpShape* cpSegmentShapeNew(cpBody *body, cpVect a, cpVect b, cpFloat radius)
```

`body` is the body to attach the segment to, `a` and `b` are the endpoints, and
`radius` is the thickness of the segment.

```c
cpVect cpSegmentShapeGetA(cpShape *shape)
cpVect cpSegmentShapeGetB(cpShape *shape)
cpVect cpSegmentShapeGetNormal(cpShape *shape)
cpFloat cpSegmentShapeGetRadius(cpShape *shape)
```

Getters for segment shape properties. Passing a non-segment shape will throw an
assertion.

```c
void cpSegmentShapeSetNeighbors(cpShape *shape, cpVect prev, cpVect next)
```

When you have a number of segment shapes that are all joined together, things
can still collide with the "cracks" between the segments. By setting the
neighbor segment endpoints you can tell Chipmunk to avoid colliding with the
inner parts of the crack.

### Working With Polygon Shapes

```c
cpPolyShape *cpPolyShapeAlloc(void)
cpPolyShape *cpPolyShapeInit(cpPolyShape *poly, cpBody *body, int count, const cpVect *verts, cpTransform transform, cpFloat radius)
cpShape *cpPolyShapeNew(cpBody *body, int numVerts, cpVect *verts, cpTransform transform, cpFloat radius)
```

`body` is the body to attach the poly to, `verts` is an array of `cpVect`
structs, `transform` will be applied to every vertex. A convex hull will be
calculated from the vertexes automatically. The polygon shape will be created
with a `radius`, increasing the size of the shape.

```c
cpPolyShape* cpPolyShapeInitRaw(cpPolyShape *poly, cpBody *body, int count, const cpVect *verts, cpFloat radius)
cpShape* cpPolyShapeNewRaw(cpBody *body, int count, const cpVect *verts, cpFloat radius)
```

Alternate constructors for poly shapes. This version does not apply a transform
nor does it create a convex hull. Vertices _must_ be provided with a
counter-clockwise winding.

```c
int cpPolyShapeGetCount(cpShape *shape)
cpVect cpPolyShapeGetVert(cpShape *shape, int index)
cpFloat cpPolyShapeGetRadius()
```

Getters for poly shape properties. Passing a non-poly shape or an index that
does not exist will throw an assertion.

#### Boxes

Because boxes are so common in physics games, Chipmunk provides shortcuts to
create box shaped polygons. The boxes will always be centered at the center of
gravity of the body you are attaching them to. Adding a small radius will bevel
the corners and can significantly reduce problems where the box gets stuck on
seams in your geometry. If you want to create an off-center box, you will need
to use `cpPolyShapeNew()` or `cpPolyShapeInit()`.

```c
cpPolyShape *cpBoxShapeInit(cpPolyShape *poly, cpBody *body, cpFloat width, cpFloat height, cpFloat radius)
cpPolyShape *cpBoxShapeInit2(cpPolyShape *poly, cpBody *body, cpBB box, cpFloat radius)
cpShape *cpBoxShapeNew(cpBody *body, cpFloat width, cpFloat height, cpFloat radius)
cpShape *cpBoxShapeNew2(cpBody *body, cpBB box, cpFloat radius)
```

#### Poly Shape Helper Functions

- `cpVect cpCentroidForPoly(const int count, const cpVect *verts)` - Calculate
  the centroid for a polygon.

#### Convex Hull Helper Functions

```c
int cpConvexHull(int count, cpVect *verts, cpVect *result, int *first, cpFloat tol)
```

Calculate the convex hull of a given set of points. Returns the count of points
in the hull. `result` must be a pointer to a `cpVect` array with at least
`count` elements. If `result` is `NULL`, then `verts` array will be reduced
instead. `first` is an optional pointer to an integer to store where the first
vertex in the hull came from (i.e. `verts[first] == result[0]`) `tol` is the
allowed amount to shrink the hull when simplifying it. A tolerance of 0.0
creates an exact hull.

```c
#define CP_CONVEX_HULL(inputCount, inputVerts, outputCount_varName, outputVerts_varName)
```

Convenience macro for using `cpConvexHull()`. Creates an array on the stack
using `alloca()` and then calls `cpConvexHull()`. Because the output array is
created on the stack it doesn't need to be freed.

#### Convex Hull Example

```c
int first = 0;

// Create space to store the convex hull.
// An alloca(), or a variable length array would be a better, but not always portable choice.
cpVect *hullVerts = (cpVect *)calloc(vertCount, sizeof(cpVect));
int hullCount = cpConvexHull(vertCount, verts, hullVerts, &first, 0.0);

// hullVerts[0] will be equal to verts[first] here.
// If you don't care, pass NULL instead of the 'first' pointer.

cpBody *body = cpBodyNew(mass, cpMomentForPoly(mass, hullCount, hullVerts, cpvzero));
cpShape *shape = cpPolyShapeNew(body, hullCount, hullVerts, cpvzero);

free(hullVerts);

// *********
// Altenatively you can use the CP_CONVEX_HULL() macro to save yourself a little work

// The macro will declare the hullCount and hullVerts variables.
// hullVerts is allocated on the stack and does not need to be freed.
CP_CONVEX_HULL(count, verts, hullCount, hullVerts)

cpBody *body = cpBodyNew(mass, cpMomentForPoly(mass, hullCount, hullVerts, cpvzero));
cpShape *shape = cpPolyShapeNew(body, hullCount, hullVerts, cpvzero);
```

### Modifying `cpShapes`

The short answer is that you can't because the changes would be only picked up
as a change to the position of the shape's surface, but not its velocity. The
long answer is that you can using the "unsafe" API as long as you realize that
doing so will result in unrealistic physical behavior. These extra functions are
defined in a separate header `chipmunk_unsafe.h`.

### Notes

- You can attach multiple collision shapes to a rigid body. This should allow
  you to create almost any shape you could possibly need.
- Shapes attached to the same rigid body will never generate collisions. You
  don't have to worry about overlap when attaching multiple shapes to a rigid
  body.
- Make sure you add both the body and its collision shapes to a space.

## Spaces `cpSpace`

Spaces in Chipmunk are the basic unit of simulation. You add rigid bodies,
shapes, and constraints to the space and then step them all forward through time
together.

### What Are Iterations, and Why Should I Care? {#cpSpace-Iterations}

Chipmunk uses an iterative solver to figure out the forces between objects in
the space. What this means is that it builds a big list of all the collisions,
joints, and other constraints between the bodies and makes several passes over
the list considering each one individually. The number of passes it makes is the
iteration count, and each iteration makes the solution more accurate. If you use
too many iterations, the physics should look nice and solid, but may use up too
much CPU time. If you use too few iterations, the simulation may seem mushy or
bouncy when the objects should be solid. Setting the number of iterations lets
you balance between CPU usage and the accuracy of the physics. Chipmunk's
default of 8 iterations is sufficient for most simple games. Applications that
need stiffer stacks or constraints can raise the iteration count explicitly.

### Sleeping {#cpSpace-Sleeping}

Spaces can disable entire groups of objects that have stopped moving to save CPU
time and battery life. In order to use this feature you must do two things. You
must enable sleeping explicitly by choosing a time threshold value for
`cpSpace.sleepTimeThreshold`. This threshold is the amount of time something
must be idle before it falls asleep. `cpSpace.idleSpeedThreshold` defines what
is considered idle. If you do not set `cpSpace.idleSpeedThreshold` explicitly, a
value will be chosen automatically based on the current amount of gravity. Be
mindful that objects cannot fall asleep if they are touching or jointed to a
kinematic body.

### Properties

```c
int cpSpaceGetIterations(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetIterations(cpSpace *space, int value)
```

Iterations allow you to control the accuracy of the solver. Defaults to 10. See
[above](#cpSpace-Iterations) for more information.

```c
cpVect cpSpaceGetGravity(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetGravity(cpSpace *space, cpVect value)
```

Global gravity applied to the space. Defaults to `cpvzero`. Can be overridden on
a per-body basis by writing custom integration functions. Changing the gravity
will activate all sleeping bodies in the space.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetDamping(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetDamping(cpSpace *space, cpFloat value)
```

Amount of simple damping to apply to the space. A value of 0.9 means that each
body will lose 10% of its velocity per second. Defaults to 1. Like `gravity`, it
can be overridden on a per body basis.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetIdleSpeedThreshold(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetIdleSpeedThreshold(cpSpace *space, cpFloat value)
```

Speed threshold for a body to be considered idle. The default value of 0 means
the space estimates a good threshold based on gravity.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetSleepTimeThreshold(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetSleepTimeThreshold(cpSpace *space, cpFloat value)
```

Time a group of bodies must remain idle in order to fall asleep. The default
value of `INFINITY` disables the sleeping feature.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetCollisionSlop(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetCollisionSlop(cpSpace *space, cpFloat value)
```

Amount of overlap between shapes that is allowed. To improve stability, set this
as high as you can without noticeable overlapping. It defaults to 0.1.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetCollisionBias(const cpSpace *space)
    void cpSpaceSetCollisionBias(cpSpace *space, cpFloat value)
```

Chipmunk allows fast moving objects to overlap, then fixes the overlap over
time. Overlapping objects are unavoidable even if swept collisions are
supported, and this is an efficient and stable way to deal with overlapping
objects. The bias value controls what percentage of overlap remains unfixed
after a second and defaults to ~0.2%. Valid values are in the range from 0 to 1,
but using 0 is not recommended for stability reasons. The default value is
calculated as `cpfpow(1.0f - 0.1f, 60.0f)` meaning that Chipmunk attempts to
correct 10% of error ever 1/60th of a second. **Note:** Very, very few games
will need to change this value.

```c
cpTimestamp cpSpaceGetCollisionPersistence(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetCollisionPersistence(cpSpace *space, cpTimestamp value)
```

The number of frames the space keeps collision solutions around for. Helps
prevent jittering contacts from getting worse. This defaults to 3 and very very
_very_ few games will need to change this value.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceGetCurrentTimeStep(const cpSpace *space)
```

Retrieves the current (if you are in a callback from `cpSpaceStep()`) or most
recent (outside of a `cpSpaceStep()` call) timestep.

```c
cpFloat cpSpaceIsLocked(const cpSpace *space)
```

Returns true when you cannot add/remove objects from the space. In particular,
spaces are locked when in a collision callback. Instead, run your code in a
post-step callback instead.

```c
cpDataPointer cpSpaceGetUserData(const cpSpace *space)
void cpSpaceSetUserData(cpSpace *space, cpDataPointer value)
```

A user definable data pointer. It is often useful to point this at the game
state object or scene management object that owns the space.

```c
cpBody * cpSpaceGetStaticBody(const cpSpace *space)
```

A dedicated static body for the space. You don't have to use it, but because its
memory is managed automatically with the space its very convenient. You can set
its user data pointer to something helpful if you want for callbacks.

### Memory Management Functions

```c
cpSpace* cpSpaceAlloc(void)
    cpSpace* cpSpaceInit(cpSpace *space)
    cpSpace* cpSpaceNew()

    void cpSpaceDestroy(cpSpace *space)
    void cpSpaceFree(cpSpace *space)
```

More standard Chipmunk memory functions.

### Operations

```c
cpShape *cpSpaceAddShape(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape)
cpBody *cpSpaceAddBody(cpSpace *space, cpBody *body)
cpConstraint *cpSpaceAddConstraint(cpSpace *space, cpConstraint *constraint)

void cpSpaceRemoveShape(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape)
void cpSpaceRemoveBody(cpSpace *space, cpBody *body)
void cpSpaceRemoveConstraint(cpSpace *space, cpConstraint *constraint)

cpBool cpSpaceContainsShape(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape)
cpBool cpSpaceContainsBody(cpSpace *space, cpBody *body)
cpBool cpSpaceContainsConstraint(cpSpace *space, cpConstraint *constraint)
```

These functions add and remove shapes, bodies and constraints from `space`. The
add/remove functions cannot be called from within a callback other than a
`postStep()` callback _(which is different from a postSolve() callback!)_.
Attempting to add or remove objects from the space while `cpSpaceStep()` is
still executing will throw an assertion. See the [callbacks section](#Callbacks)
for more information. The add functions return the thing being added so that you
can create and add something in one line. Be careful not to free bodies before
removing shapes and constraints attached to them, or you will cause crashes. The
contains functions allow you to check if an object has been added to the space
or not.

### Spatial Indexing

Occasionally, you might want to update the collision detection data for a shape.
If you move a static shape or a static body you **must** do this to let Chipmunk
know it needs to have its collision detection data updated. You may also want to
manually update the collision data for normal shapes if you move them and still
want to perform queries against them before the next call to `cpSpaceStep()`.

- `void cpSpaceReindexShape(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape)` - Reindex a
  specific shape.
- `void cpSpaceReindexShapesForBody(cpSpace *space, cpBody *body)` - Reindex all
  the shapes for a certain body.
- `void cpSpaceReindexStatic(cpSpace *space)` - Reindex all static shapes.
  Generally updating only the shapes that changed is faster.

### Iterators

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceBodyIteratorFunc)(cpBody *body, void *data)
void cpSpaceEachBody(cpSpace *space, cpSpaceBodyIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

Call `func` for each body in the space also passing along your data pointer.
Sleeping bodies are included, but static and kinematic bodies are not as they
aren't added to the space.

#### cpSpaceEachBody Example

```c
// Code snippet to check if all bodies in the space are sleeping

// This function is called once for each body in the space.
static void EachBody(cpBody *body, cpBool *allSleeping){
  if(!cpBodyIsSleeping(body)) *allSleeping = cpFalse;
}

// Then in your tick method, do this:
cpBool allSleeping = true;
cpSpaceEachBody(space, (cpSpaceBodyIteratorFunc)EachBody, &allSleeping);
printf("All are sleeping: %s\n", allSleeping ? "true" : "false");
```

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceShapeIteratorFunc)(cpShape *shape, void *data)
void cpSpaceEachShape(cpSpace *space, cpSpaceShapeIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

Call `func` for each shape in the space also passing along your data pointer.
Sleeping and static shapes are included.

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceConstraintIteratorFunc)(cpConstraint *constraint, void *data)
void cpSpaceEachConstraint(cpSpace *space, cpSpaceConstraintIteratorFunc func, void *data)
```

Call `func` for each constraint in the space also passing along your data
pointer.

**Note:** If your compiler supports blocks (such as Clang), there are an
alternate set of functions you can call. `cpSpaceEachBody_b()`, etc. See
`chipmunk.h` for more information.

### Simulating the Space

```c
void cpSpaceStep(cpSpace *space, cpFloat dt)
```

Update the space for the given time step. Using a fixed time step is _highly_
recommended. Doing so can greatly increase the quality of the simulation. The
easiest way to do constant timesteps is to simple step forward by 1/60th of a
second (or whatever your target framerate is) for each frame regardless of how
long it took to render. This works fine for many games, but a better way to do
it is to separate your physics timestep and rendering.
[This](http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/) is a good
article on how to do that.

### Enabling and Tuning the Spatial Hash

Chipmunk officially supports two spatial indexes. The default is an axis-aligned
bounding box tree inspired by the one used in the Bullet Physics library, but
caching of overlapping leaves was added to give it very good temporal coherence.
The tree requires no tuning, and most games will find that they get the best
performance using from the tree. The other available spatial index type
available is a spatial hash, which can be much faster when you have a very large
number (1000s) of objects that are all the same size. For smaller numbers of
objects, or objects that vary a lot in size, the spatial hash is usually much
slower. It also requires tuning (usually through experimentation) to get the
best possible performance.

```c
void cpSpaceUseSpatialHash(cpSpace *space, cpFloat dim, int count)
```

Switch the space to use a spatial hash instead of the bounding box tree.

The spatial hash data is fairly size sensitive. `dim` is the size of the hash
cells. Setting `dim` to the average collision shape size is likely to give the
best performance. Setting `dim` too small will cause the shape to be inserted
into many cells, setting it too low will cause too many objects into the same
hash slot.

`count` is the _suggested_ minimum number of cells in the hash table. If there
are too few cells, the spatial hash will return many false positives. Too many
cells will be hard on the cache and waste memory. The Setting `count` to \~10x
the number of objects in the space is probably a good starting point. Tune from
there if necessary.

Using the spatial has visualization in the demo program you can see what I mean.
The gray squares represent cells in the spatial hash. The darker the cell, the
more objects have been mapped into that cell. A good `dim` size is when your
objects fit nicely into the grid:

![](images/hash_just_right.png)

Notice the light gray meaning that each cell doesn't have too many objects
mapped onto it.

When you use too small a size, Chipmunk has to insert each object into a lot of
cells. This can get expensive.

![](images/hash_too_small.png)

Notice that the gray cells are very small compared to the collision shapes.

When you use too big of a size, a lot of shapes will fit into each cell. Each
shape has to be checked against every other shape in the cell, so this makes for
a lot of unnecessary collision checks.

![](images/hash_too_big.png)

Notice the dark gray cells meaning that many objects are mapped onto them.

Chipmunk also has an experimental single axis sort and sweep implementation. It
can be very efficient on mobile games if your world is very long and flat like a
racing game. See the code for `cpSpaceUseSpatialHash()` if you want to try
enabling it.

### Notes

- When removing objects from the space, make sure you remove any other objects
  that reference it. For instance, when you remove a body, remove the joints and
  shapes attached to it.
- Using more iterations or smaller time steps will increase the physics quality,
  but also increase the CPU usage.
- Because static shapes are only rehashed when you request it, TODO:
  `cpSpaceHashResize`

## Constraints: `cpConstraint`

A constraint is something that describes how two bodies interact with each
other. (how they constrain each other) Constraints can be simple joints that
allow bodies to pivot around each other like the bones in your body, or they can
be more abstract like the gear joint or motors.

### What constraints are and what they are not

Constraints in Chipmunk are all velocity based constraints. This means that they
act primarily by synchronizing the velocity of two bodies. A pivot joint holds
two anchor points on two separate bodies together by defining equations that say
that the velocity of the anchor points must be the same and calculating impulses
to apply to the bodies to try and keep it that way. A constraint takes a
velocity as it's primary input and produces a velocity change as its output.
Some constraints, (joints in particular) apply velocity changes to correct
differences in positions. More about this in the next section.

A spring connected between two bodies is not a constraint. It's very
constraint-like as it creates forces that affect the velocities of the two
bodies, but a spring takes distances as input and produces forces as its output.
If a spring is not a constraint, then why do I have two varieties of spring
constraints you ask? The reason is that they are _damped springs_. The damping
associated with the spring is a true constraint that creates velocity changes
based on the relative velocities of the two bodies it links. As it is convenient
to put a damper and a spring together most of the time, I figured I might as
well just apply the spring force as part of the constraint instead of having a
damper constraint and having the user calculate and apply their own spring
forces separately.

### Properties

```c
cpBody * cpConstraintGetA(const cpConstraint *constraint)
cpBody * cpConstraintGetB(const cpConstraint *constraint)
```

Getters for the two bodies the constraint is attached to.

```c
cpFloat cpConstraintGetMaxForce(const cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintSetMaxForce(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)
```

The maximum force that the constraint can use to act on the two bodies. Defaults
to INFINITY.

```c
cpFloat cpConstraintGetErrorBias(const cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintSetErrorBias(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)
```

The percentage of joint error that remains unfixed after a second. This works
exactly the same as the collision bias property of a space, but applies to
fixing error (stretching) of joints instead of overlapping collisions.

```c
cpFloat cpConstraintGetMaxBias(const cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintSetMaxBias(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)
```

The maximum speed at which the constraint can apply error correction. Defaults
to INFINITY.

```c
cpSpace* cpConstraintGetSpace(const cpConstraint *constraint)
```

Get the `cpSpace` that `constraint` has been added to.

```c
cpBool cpConstraintGetCollideBodies(const cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintSetCollideBodies(cpConstraint *constraint, cpBool collideBodies)
```

Constraints can be used for filtering collisions too. When two bodies collide,
Chipmunk ignores the collisions if this property is set to `cpFalse` on any
constraint that connects the two bodies. Defaults to `cpTrue`. This can be used
to create a chain that self collides, but adjacent links in the chain do not
collide.

```c
cpDataPointer cpConstraintGetUserData(const cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintSetUserData(cpConstraint *constraint, cpDataPointer value)
```

User data pointer. Use this pointer to get a reference to the game object that
owns this constraint from callbacks.

```c
cpFloat cpConstraintGetImpulse(cpConstraint *constraint)
```

The most recent impulse that `constraint` applied. To convert this to a force,
divide by the timestep passed to `cpSpaceStep()`. You can use this to implement
breakable joints to check if the force they attempted to apply exceeded a
certain threshold.

#### Breakable Joint Example

```c
// Create the joint and set it's max force property.
breakableJoint = cpSpaceAddConstraint(space, cpPinJointNew(body1, body2, cpv(15,0), cpv(-15,0)));
cpConstraintSetMaxForce(breakableJoint, 4000);


// In your update function:
// Step your space normally...
cpFloat dt = 1.0/60.0;
cpSpaceStep(space, dt);

if(breakableJoint){
  // Convert the impulse to a force by dividing it by the timestep.
  cpFloat force = cpConstraintGetImpulse(breakableJoint)/dt;
  cpFloat maxForce = cpConstraintGetMaxForce(breakableJoint);

  // If the force is almost as big as the joint's max force, break it.
  if(force > 0.9*maxForce){
    cpSpaceRemoveConstraint(space, breakableJoint);
    breakableJoint = NULL;
  }
}
```

To access properties of specific joint types, use the getter and setter
functions provided (ex: `cpPinJointGetanchorA()`). See the lists of properties
for more information.

### Error correction by Feedback

Joints in Chipmunk are not perfect. A pin joint can't maintain the exact correct
distance between its anchor points, nor can a pivot joint hold its anchor points
completely together. Instead, they are designed to deal with this by correcting
themselves over time. Since Chipmunk 5, you have a fair amount of extra control
over how joints correct themselves and can even use this ability to create
physical effects that allow you to use joints in unique ways:

- Servo motors - Ex: open/close doors or rotate things without going over a
  maximum force.
- Winches - Pull one object towards another at a constant speed without going
  over a maximum force.
- Mouse manipulation - Interact with objects smoothly given coarse/shaky mouse
  input.

There are three properties of `cpConstraint` structs that control the error
correction, `maxForce`, `maxBias`, and `biasCoef`. `maxForce` is pretty
self-explanatory, a joint or constraint will not be able to use more than this
amount of force in order to function. If it needs more force to be able to hold
itself together, it will fall apart. `maxBias` is the maximum speed at which
error correction can be applied. If you change a property on a joint so that the
joint will have to correct itself, it normally does so very quickly. By setting
a `maxSpeed` you can make the joint work like a servo, correcting itself at a
constant rate over a longer period of time. Lastly, `biasCoef` is the percentage
of error corrected every step before clamping to a maximum speed. You can use
this to make joints correct themselves smoothly instead of at a constant speed,
but is probably the least useful of the three properties by far.

<!-- TODO more examples -->

#### Joint Recipes

```c
// Faked top down friction.

// A pivot joint configured this way will calculate friction against the ground for games with a top down perspective.
// Because the joint correction is disabled, the joint will not recenter itself and only apply to the velocity.
// The force the joint applies when changing the velocity will be clamped by the max force
// and this causes it to work exactly like friction!
cpConstraint *pivot = cpSpaceAddConstraint(space, cpPivotJointNew2(staticBody, body, cpvzero, cpvzero));
cpConstraintSetMaxBias(pivot, 0.0f); // disable joint correction
cpConstraintSetMaxForce(pivot, 1000.0f);

// The pivot joint doesn't apply rotational forces, use a gear joint with a ratio of 1.0 for that.
cpConstraint *gear = cpSpaceAddConstraint(space, cpGearJointNew(staticBody, body, 0.0f, 1.0f));
cpConstraintSetMaxBias(gear, 0.0f); // disable joint correction
cpConstraintSetMaxForce(gear, 5000.0f);

// Also, instead of connecting the joints to a static body, you can connect them to an infinite mass rogue body.
// You can then use the rogue body as a control body to the connected body. See the Tank demo as an example.
```

### Constraints and Collision Shapes

Neither constraints nor collision shapes have any knowledge of the other. When
connecting joints to a body the anchor points don't need to be inside any shapes
attached to the body, and it often makes sense that they shouldn't. Also, adding
a constraint between two bodies doesn't prevent their collision shapes from
colliding. In fact, this is the primary reason that the collision group property
exists.

### Shared Memory Management Functions

```c
void cpConstraintDestroy(cpConstraint *constraint)
void cpConstraintFree(cpConstraint *constraint)
```

`Destroy` and `Free` functions are shared by all joint types. Allocation and
initialization functions are specific to each joint type.

## Constraint Types

### Pin Joints

```c
cpPinJoint *cpPinJointAlloc(void)
cpPinJoint *cpPinJointInit(cpPinJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB)
cpConstraint *cpPinJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB)
```

`a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, and `anchorA` and `anchorB` are the
anchor points on those bodies. The distance between the two anchor points is
measured when the joint is created. If you want to set a specific distance, use
the setter function to override it.

#### Properties

- `cpVect cpPinJointGetanchorA(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpPinJointSetanchorA(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpPinJointGetanchorB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpPinJointSetanchorB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpFloat cpPinJointGetDist(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpPinJointSetDist(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Slide Joints

```c
cpSlideJoint *cpSlideJointAlloc(void)

cpSlideJoint *cpSlideJointInit(
    cpSlideJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b,
    cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB, cpFloat min, cpFloat max
)

cpConstraint *cpSlideJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)
```

`a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, `anchorA` and `anchorB` are the
anchor points on those bodies, and `min` and `max` define the allowed distances
of the anchor points.

#### Properties

- `cpVect cpSlideJointGetanchorA(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpSlideJointSetanchorA(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpSlideJointGetanchorB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpSlideJointSetanchorB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpFloat cpSlideJointGetMin(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpSlideJointSetMin(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpSlideJointGetMax(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpSlideJointSetMax(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Pivot Joints

```c
cpPivotJoint *cpPivotJointAlloc(void)
cpPivotJoint *cpPivotJointInit(cpPivotJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect pivot)
cpConstraint *cpPivotJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect pivot)
cpConstraint *cpPivotJointNew2(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB)
```

`a` and `b` are the two bodies to connect, and `pivot` is the point in world
coordinates of the pivot. Because the pivot location is given in world
coordinates, you must have the bodies moved into the correct positions already.
Alternatively you can specify the joint based on a pair of anchor points, but
make sure you have the bodies in the right place as the joint will fix itself as
soon as you start simulating the space.

#### Properties

- `cpVect cpPivotJointGetanchorA(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpPivotJointSetanchorA(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpPivotJointGetanchorB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpPivotJointSetanchorB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`

### Groove Joint

```c
cpGrooveJoint *cpGrooveJointAlloc(void)

cpGrooveJoint *cpGrooveJointInit(
    cpGrooveJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b,
    cpVect groove_a, cpVect groove_b, cpVect anchorB
)

cpConstraint *cpGrooveJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect groove_a, cpVect groove_b, cpVect anchorB)
```

The groove goes from `groov_a` to `groove_b` on body `a`, and the pivot is
attached to `anchorB` on body `b`. All coordinates are body local.

#### Properties

- `cpVect cpGrooveJointGetGrooveA(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpGrooveJointSetGrooveA(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpGrooveJointGetGrooveB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpGrooveJointSetGrooveB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpGrooveJointGetanchorB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpGrooveJointSetanchorB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`

### Damped Spring

```c
cpDampedSpring *cpDampedSpringAlloc(void)

cpDampedSpring *cpDampedSpringInit(
    cpDampedSpring *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB,
    cpFloat restLength, cpFloat stiffness, cpFloat damping
)

cpConstraint *cpDampedSpringNew(
    cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpVect anchorA, cpVect anchorB,
    cpFloat restLength, cpFloat stiffness, cpFloat damping
)
```

Defined much like a slide joint. `restLength` is the distance the spring wants
to be, `stiffness` is the spring constant
([Young's modulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus)), and `damping`
is how soft to make the damping of the spring.

#### Properties

- `cpVect cpDampedSpringGetanchorA(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedSpringSetanchorA(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpVect cpDampedSpringGetanchorB(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedSpringSetanchorB(cpConstraint *constraint, cpVect value)`
- `cpFloat cpDampedSpringGetRestLength(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedSpringSetRestLength(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpDampedSpringGetStiffness(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedSpringSetStiffness(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpDampedSpringGetDamping(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedSpringSetDamping(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Damped Rotary Spring

```c
cpDampedRotarySpring *cpDampedRotarySpringAlloc(void)

cpDampedRotarySpring *cpDampedRotarySpringInit(
    cpDampedRotarySpring *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b,
    cpFloat restAngle, cpFloat stiffness, cpFloat damping
)

cpConstraint *cpDampedRotarySpringNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat restAngle, cpFloat stiffness, cpFloat damping)
```

Like a damped spring, but works in an angular fashion. `restAngle` is the
relative angle in radians that the bodies want to have, `stiffness` and
`damping` work basically the same as on a damped spring.

#### Properties

- `cpFloat cpDampedRotarySpringGetRestAngle(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedRotarySpringSetRestAngle(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpDampedRotarySpringGetStiffness(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedRotarySpringSetStiffness(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpDampedRotarySpringGetDamping(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpDampedRotarySpringSetDamping(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Rotary Limit Joint

```c
cpRotaryLimitJoint *cpRotaryLimitJointAlloc(void)
cpRotaryLimitJoint *cpRotaryLimitJointInit(cpRotaryLimitJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)
cpConstraint *cpRotaryLimitJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat min, cpFloat max)
```

Constrains the relative rotations of two bodies. `min` and `max` are the angular
limits in radians. It is implemented so that it's possible to for the range to
be greater than a full revolution.

#### Properties

- `cpFloat cpRotaryLimitJointGetMin(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpRotaryLimitJointSetMin(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpRotaryLimitJointGetMax(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpRotaryLimitJointSetMax(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Ratchet Joint

```c
cpRatchetJoint *cpRatchetJointAlloc(void);
cpRatchetJoint *cpRatchetJointInit(cpRatchetJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat phase, cpFloat ratchet);
cpConstraint *cpRatchetJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat phase, cpFloat ratchet);
```

Works like a socket wrench. `ratchet` is the distance between "clicks", `phase`
is the initial offset to use when deciding where the ratchet angles are.

#### Properties

- `cpFloat cpRatchetJointGetAngle(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpRatchetJointSetAngle(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpRatchetJointGetPhase(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpRatchetJointSetPhase(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpRatchetJointGetRatchet(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpRatchetJointSetRatchet(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Gear Joint

```c
cpGearJoint *cpGearJointAlloc(void);
cpGearJoint *cpGearJointInit(cpGearJoint *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat phase, cpFloat ratio);
cpConstraint *cpGearJointNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat phase, cpFloat ratio);
```

Keeps the angular velocity ratio of a pair of bodies constant. `ratio` is always
measured in absolute terms. It is currently not possible to set the ratio in
relation to a third body's angular velocity. `phase` is the initial angular
offset of the two bodies.

#### Properties

- `cpFloat cpGearJointGetPhase(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpGearJointSetPhase(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`
- `cpFloat cpGearJointGetRatio(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpGearJointSetRatio(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Simple Motor

```c
cpSimpleMotor *cpSimpleMotorAlloc(void);
cpSimpleMotor *cpSimpleMotorInit(cpSimpleMotor *joint, cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat rate);
cpConstraint *cpSimpleMotorNew(cpBody *a, cpBody *b, cpFloat rate);
```

Keeps the relative angular velocity of a pair of bodies constant. `rate` is the
desired relative angular velocity. You will usually want to set a force (torque)
maximum for motors as otherwise they will be able to apply a nearly infinite
torque to keep the bodies moving.

#### Properties

- `cpFloat cpSimpleMotorGetRate(const cpConstraint *constraint)`
- `void cpSimpleMotorSetRate(cpConstraint *constraint, cpFloat value)`

### Notes

- You can add multiple joints between two bodies, but make sure that they don't
  fight. Doing so can cause the bodies jitter or spin violently.

## Overview of Collision Detection

In order to make collision detection in Chipmunk as fast as possible, the
process is broken down into several stages. While it tries to be conceptually
simple, the implementation can be a bit daunting. Fortunately as a user of the
library, you don't need to understand everything about how it works. Though if
you are trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of Chipmunk,
understanding this section can be helpful.

### Spatial Indexing

A for loop that checks every object against every other object in the scene
would be _very_ slow. So the first stage of the collision detection, commonly
called the broadphase, uses a high level spatial algorithm to decide which pairs
of objects to check for collisions. Currently, Chipmunk supports two spatial
indexes, an axis-aligned bounding box tree and a spatial hash. These spatial
indexes are able to quickly identify which pairs of shapes are near each other
and should be checked for a collision.

### Fast Collision Filtering

After the spatial index figures out which pairs of shapes are likely to be near
each other, it passes each pair back to the space using a callback to perform
some additional filtering on the pairs. Before doing anything else, Chipmunk
performs a few quick tests to check if shapes should collide.

- **Bounding Box Test:** The shapes are not colliding if their bounding boxes
  are not overlapping. Objects like diagonal line segments can trigger a lot of
  false positives here, but it's unlikely to be something you should worry
  about.
- **Category Mask Test:** The categories of each shape are bitwise ANDed against
  the category mask of the other shape. If either result is 0, the shapes do not
  collide.
- **Group Test:** Shapes shouldn't collide with other shapes in the same
  non-zero group.

### Constraint Based Filtering

After fast collision filtering, Chipmunk checks the list of joints on one of the
bodies to see if it has a constraint that attaches it to the other body. If that
constraint's `collideBodies` property is false, the collision will be ignored.
This check is often very fast since most scenes don't contain a lot of
constraints.

### Primitive Shape to Shape Collision Detection

The most expensive test is to actually check for overlap based on their
geometry. Circle to circle and circle to line collisions are very fast. Segment
to segment and poly to poly collisions are handled using the GJK/EPA algorithms,
and get more expensive as the number of vertexes increases. Simpler shapes make
for faster collisions, and often more important, fewer collision points for the
solver to run. Chipmunk uses a small dispatch table to figure out which function
to use to check if the shapes overlap.

Without going into too much detail, the GJK algorithm checks the distance
between two objects, and the EPA algorithm checks how much they are overlapping.
If you give your segment and poly shapes a small radius when creating them, the
EPA algorithm can usually be skipped, speeding up the collision detection
considerably. The radius should be at least as big as the amount of allowed
collision slop.

### Collision Handler Filtering

After checking if two shapes overlap Chipmunk will look to see if you have
defined a collision handler for the collision types of the shapes. This is vital
to process collisions events for the gameplay, but also gives you a very
flexible way to filter out collisions. The return value of the `begin()` and
`preSolve()` callbacks determines whether the colliding pair of shapes is
discarded or not. Returning true will keep the pair, false will discard it.
Rejecting a collision from a `begin()` callback is permanent, rejecting it from
the `preSolve()` only applies to the step it occurred in. If you don't define a
handler for the given collision types, Chipmunk will call the space's default
handler, which by default is defined to simply accept all collisions.

Wildcard collisions can also return a value, but they are handled in a more
complicated way. When you create a collision handler between two specific
collision types, it's your responsibility to decide when to call the wildcard
handlers and what to do with their return values. Otherwise, the default is to
call the wildcard handler for the first type, then the second type, and use a
logical AND of their return values as filtering value. See `DefaultBegin()` in
`cpSpace.c` for more information.

While using callbacks to filter collisions is the most flexible way, keep in
mind that by the time your callback is called all the most expensive collision
detection has already been done. For simulations with a lot of colliding objects
each frame, the time spent finding collisions is small compared to the time
spent solving the physics for them so it may not be a big deal. Fast collision
filtering should be preferred if possible.

## Collision Callbacks

A physics library without any events or feedback would not be very useful for
games. How would you know when the player bumped into an enemy so that you could
take some health points away? How would you know how hard the car hit something
so you don't play a loud crash noise when a pebble hits it? What if you need to
decide if a collision should be ignored based on specific conditions, like
implementing one way platforms? Chipmunk has a number of powerful callback
systems that you can use to solve these problems.

### Collision Handlers

A collision handler is a set of 4 function callbacks for the different collision
events that Chipmunk recognizes. The event types are:

- `begin()`: Two shapes just started touching for the first time this step.
  Return true from the callback to process the collision normally or false to
  cause Chipmunk to ignore the collision entirely. If you return false, the
  `preSolve()` and `postSolve()` callbacks will never be run, but you will still
  receive a separate event when the shapes stop overlapping.
- `preSolve()`: Two shapes are touching during this step. Return false from the
  callback to make Chipmunk ignore the collision this step or true to process it
  normally. Additionally, you may override collision values using
  `cpArbiterSetFriction()`, `cpArbiterSetElasticity()` or
  `cpArbiterSetSurfaceVelocity()` to provide custom friction, elasticity, or
  surface velocity values. See [`cpArbiter`](#cpArbiter) for more info.
- `postSolve()`: Two shapes are touching, and their collision response has been
  processed. You can retrieve the collision impulse or kinetic energy at this
  time if you want to use it to calculate sound volumes or damage amounts. See
  [`cpArbiter`](#cpArbiter) for more info.
- `separate()`: Two shapes have just stopped touching for the first time this
  step. To ensure that begin()/separate() are always called in balanced pairs,
  it will also be called when removing a shape while its in contact with
  something or when deallocating the space.

Collision callbacks are closely associated with [`cpArbiter`](#cpArbiter)
structs. You should familiarize yourself with those as well.

**Note:** Shapes tagged as sensors (`cpShape.sensor == true`) never generate
collisions that get processed, so collisions between sensors shapes and other
shapes will never call the `postSolve()` callback. They still generate
`begin()`, and `separate()` callbacks, and the `preSolve()` callback is also
called every frame even though there is no collision response.

**Note #2:** `preSolve()` callbacks are called before the sleeping algorithm
runs. If an object falls asleep, its `postSolve()` callback won't be called
until it's reawoken.

### Collision Handler API

```c
typedef int (*cpCollisionBeginFunc)(cpArbiter *arb, struct cpSpace *space, cpDataPointer data)
typedef int (*cpCollisionPreSolveFunc)(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, cpDataPointer data)
typedef void (*cpCollisionPostSolveFunc)(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, cpDataPointer data)
typedef void (*cpCollisionSeparateFunc)(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, cpDataPointer data)
```

Collision handler function types. While all of them take an arbiter, space, and
a user data pointer, only the `begin()` and `preSolve()` callbacks return a
value. See above for more information.

```c
struct cpCollisionHandler {
    cpCollisionType typeA, typeB;
    cpCollisionBeginFunc beginFunc;
    cpCollisionPreSolveFunc preSolveFunc;
    cpCollisionPostSolveFunc postSolveFunc;
    cpCollisionSeparateFunc separateFunc;
    cpDataPointer userData;
};
```

This collision handler processes collisions between objects of type `typeA` and
`typeB`. Fill the desired collision callback functions - they are documented
above. A user definable context pointer `userData` is included for your
convenience. This pointer is provided as an argument in each callback function.

```c
cpCollisionHandler *cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(cpSpace *space, cpCollisionType a, cpCollisionType b)
```

Add a `cpCollisionHandler` for specific collision type pair or return the
existing handler for the type pair. Whenever shapes with collision types
(`cpShape.collision_type`) `a` and `b` collide, this handler will be used to
process the collision events. When a new collision handler is created, the
callbacks will all be set to builtin callbacks that perform the default behavior
(call the wildcard handlers, and accept all collisions).

#### General Collision Callback Example

This snippet demonstrates several Chipmunk collision callback features. It
defines a collision handler that is called when collision shapes start touching
and also a post-step callback to remove the collision shape and body.

```c
static void
postStepRemove(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape, void *unused)
{
  cpSpaceRemoveBody(space, shape->body);
  cpSpaceRemoveShape(space, shape);

  cpShapeFree(shape);
  cpBodyFree(shape->body);
}

static int
begin(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, void *unused)
{
  // Get the cpShapes involved in the collision
  // The order will be the same as you defined in the handler definition
  // a->collision_type will be BULLET_TYPE and b->collision_type will be MONSTER_TYPE
  cpShape *a, *b; cpArbiterGetShapes(arb, &a, &b);

  // Alternatively you can use the CP_ARBITER_GET_SHAPES() macro
  // It defines and sets the variables for you.
  //CP_ARBITER_GET_SHAPES(arb, a, b);

  // Add a post step callback to safely remove the body and shape from the space.
  // Calling cpSpaceRemove*() directly from a collision handler callback can cause crashes.
  cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback(space, (cpPostStepFunc)postStepRemove, b, NULL);

  // The object is dead, don’t process the collision further
  return 0;
}

#define BULLET_TYPE 1
#define MONSTER_TYPE 2

// Define a collision handler for bullets and monsters
// Kill the monster by removing it’s shape and body from the space as soon as it’s hit by a bullet
cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(space, BULLET_TYPE, MONSTER_TYPE, begin, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
```

#### Play Sound On Collision Example

```c
// Callback function
static cpBool PlaySoundOnImpact(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, void *data){
    PlayCrashSound();
    return cpTrue;
}

// When setting up, reference your callback function:
{
    ...
    cpCollisionHandler *handler = cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(space, PLAYER, WALL);
    handler->postSolveFunc = PlaySoundOnImpact;
    ...
}
```

For more callback examples, see the `One Way Platform Demo`, `Sensors Demo`, or
the `Player Demo`.

```c
cpCollisionHandler *cpSpaceAddWildcardHandler(cpSpace *space, cpCollisionType type)
```

Add a wildcard collision handler for given collision type. This handler will be
used any time an object with this type collides with another object, regardless
of its type. A good example is a projectile that should be destroyed the first
time it hits anything. There may be a specific collision handler and two
wildcard handlers. It's up to the specific handler to decide if and when to call
the wildcard handlers and what to do with their return values. (See
`cpArbiterCallWildcard*()` below) When a new wildcard handler is created, the
callbacks will all be set to builtin callbacks that perform the default
behavior. (Accept all collisions in `begin()` and `preSolve()`, or do nothing
for `postSolve()` and `separate()`).

```c
cpCollisionHandler *cpSpaceAddDefaultCollisionHandler(cpSpace *space)
```

Return a reference to the default collision handler or that is used to process
all collisions that don't have a more specific handler. The default behavior for
each of the callbacks is to call the wildcard handlers, ANDing their return
values together if applicable.

### Post-Step Callbacks {#PostStep}

Post-step callbacks are the one place where you can break the rules about adding
or removing objects from within a callback. In fact, their primary function is
to help you safely remove objects from the space that you wanted to disable or
destroy in a collision or query callback.

Post step callbacks are registered as a function and a pointer that is used as a
key. You can only register one `postStep()` callback per key. This prevents you
from accidentally removing an object more than once. For instance, say that you
get a collision callback between a bullet and object A. You want to destroy both
the bullet and object A, so you register a `postStep()` callback to safely
remove them from your game. Then you get a second collision callback between the
bullet and object B. You register a `postStep()` callback to remove object B,
and a second `postStep()` callback to remove the bullet. Because you can only
register one callback per key, the `postStep()` callback for the bullet will
only be called once, and you can't accidentally try to remove it twice.

```c
typedef void (*cpPostStepFunc)(cpSpace *space, void *obj, void *data)
```

Function type used for `postStep()` callbacks. `space` is the space the callback
was registered on, `obj` is the pointer value you supplied as the key, and
`data` is a user definable pointer you can use to pass in as a context value.

```c
cpBool cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback(cpSpace *space, cpPostStepFunc func, void *key, void *data);
```

Add `func` to be called before `cpSpaceStep()` returns. `key` and `data` will be
passed to your function. Only the first callback registered for any unique value
of `key` will be recorded. It returns `cpTrue` if the callback is scheduled and
`cpfalse` when the `key` has already been used. The behavior of adding a
`postStep()` callback from outside a collision handler or query callback is
undefined.

**Note:** Post-step callbacks are not run in any particular order. If you need
to sequence a number of events, you'll need to put them in a single callback.

### Examples

See the [callback examples](examples.html#CollisionCallbacks) for more
information.

## Collision Pairs: `cpArbiter` {#cpArbiter}

Chipmunk's `cpArbiter` struct encapsulates a pair of colliding shapes and all
the data about their collision. `cpArbiter` are created when a collision starts,
and persist until those shapes are no longer colliding.

Why are they called arbiters? The short answer is that I kept using the word
"arbitrates" to describe the way that collisions were resolved, and then I saw
that Box2D actually called them arbiters way back in 2006 when I was looking at
its solver. An arbiter is like a judge, a person that has authority to settle
disputes between two people. It was a fun, fitting name and was shorter to type
than `CollisionPair` which I had been using. It was originally meant to be a
private internal structure only, but evolved to be useful from callbacks.

### Memory Management

You will never need to create or free an arbiter. More importantly, because they
are entirely managed by the space you should **never** store a reference to an
arbiter as you don't know when they will be freed or reused. Use them within the
callback where they are given to you and then forget about them or copy out the
information you need.

### Properties

```c
cpFloat cpArbiterGetElasticity(const cpArbiter *arb)
void cpArbiterSetElasticity(cpArbiter *arb, cpFloat value)
```

The calculated elasticity for this collision pair. Setting the value in a
`preSolve()` callback will override the value calculated by the space. The
default calculation multiplies the elasticity of the two shapes together.

```c
cpFloat cpArbiterGetFriction(const cpArbiter *arb)
void cpArbiterSetFriction(cpArbiter *arb, cpFloat value)
```

The calculated friction for this collision pair. Setting the value in a
`preSolve()` callback will override the value calculated by the space. The
default calculation multiplies the friction of the two shapes together.

```c
cpVect cpArbiterGetSurfaceVelocity(const cpArbiter *arb)
void cpArbiterSetSurfaceVelocity(cpArbiter *arb, cpVect value)
```

The calculated surface velocity for this collision pair. Setting the value in a
`preSolve()` callback will override the value calculated by the space. The
default calculation subtracts the surface velocity of the second shape from the
first and then projects that onto the tangent of the collision. This is so that
only friction is affected by default calculation. Using a custom calculation,
you can make something that responds like a pinball bumper, or where the surface
velocity is dependent on the location of the contact point.

```c
cpDataPointer cpArbiterGetUserData(const cpArbiter *arb)
void cpArbiterSetUserData(cpArbiter *arb, cpDataPointer data)
```

A user definable context pointer. The value will persist until just after the
`separate()` callback is called for the pair.

**NOTE:** If you need to clean up this pointer, you should implement the
`separate()` callback to do it. Also be careful when destroying the space as
there may be active collisions still. In order to trigger the `separate()`
callbacks and clean up your data, you'll need to remove all the shapes from the
space before disposing of it. This is something I'd suggest doing anyway. See
`ChipmunkDemo.c:ChipmunkDemoFreeSpaceChildren()` for an example of how to do it
easily.

```c
int cpArbiterGetCount(const cpArbiter *arb)
cpVect cpArbiterGetNormal(const cpArbiter *arb, int i)
cpVect cpArbiterGetPoint(const cpArbiter *arb, int i)
cpFloat cpArbiterGetDepth(const cpArbiter *arb, int i)
```

Get the number of contacts tracked by this arbiter or the specific collision
point, collision normal or penetration depth of a collision point. For the
foreseeable future, the maximum number of contacts will be two.

```c
cpBool cpArbiterIsFirstContact(const cpArbiter *arb)
```

Returns true if this is the first step the two shapes started touching. This can
be useful for sound effects for instance. If it's the first frame for a certain
collision, check the energy of the collision in a `postStep()` callback and use
that to determine the volume of a sound effect to play.

```c
cpBool cpArbiterIsRemoval(const cpArbiter *arb)
```

Returns `cpTrue` during a `separate()` callback if the callback was invoked due
to an object removal.

```c
void cpArbiterGetShapes(const cpArbiter *arb, cpShape **a, cpShape **b)
void cpArbiterGetBodies(const cpArbiter *arb, cpBody **a, cpBody **b)
```

Get the shapes or bodies in the order that they were defined in the collision
handler associated with this arbiter. If you defined the handler as
`cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(space, 1, 2, ...)`, you will find that
`a->collision_type == 1` and `b->collision_type == 2`.

```c
cpBool cpArbiterCallWildcardBeginA(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
cpBool cpArbiterCallWildcardBeginB(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
cpBool cpArbiterCallWildcardPreSolveA(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
cpBool cpArbiterCallWildcardPreSolveB(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
void cpArbiterCallWildcardPostSolveA(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
void cpArbiterCallWildcardPostSolveB(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
void cpArbiterCallWildcardSeparateA(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
void cpArbiterCallWildcardSeparateB(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space)
```

These functions invoke the wildcard handlers for a given collision. For custom
collision handlers between specific types or overriding the default handler, you
must decide how to invoke the wildcard handlers since it may be important to
call the wildcards first, last, or possibly skip them entirely. For the
`begin()` and `preSolve()` callbacks, you also need to decide what to do with
their return values since they may not agree with each other or the specific
handler they were called from. Every collision handler is defined for two types,
the "A" variants of these functions call the wildcard handler for the first
type, and the "B" variants call the handler for the second type.

#### Collision Callback Example

```c
static void
postStepRemove(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape, void *unused)
{
  cpSpaceRemoveShape(space, shape);
  cpSpaceRemoveBody(space, shape->body);

  cpShapeFree(shape);
  cpBodyFree(shape->body);
}

static int
begin(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, void *data)
{
  // Get the cpShapes involved in the collision
  // The order will be the same as you defined in the handler definition
  // a->collision_type will be BULLET_TYPE and b->collision_type will be MONSTER_TYPE
  CP_ARBITER_GET_SHAPES(arb, a, b);

  // The macro expands exactly as if you had typed this:
  // cpShape *a, *b; cpArbiterGetShapes(arb, &a, &b);

  // Add a post step callback to safely remove the body and shape from the space.
  // Calling cpSpaceRemove*() directly from a collision handler callback can cause crashes.
  cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback(space, (cpPostStepFunc)postStepRemove, b, NULL);

  // The object is dead, don’t process the collision further
  return 0;
}

#define BULLET_TYPE 1
#define MONSTER_TYPE 2

// Define a collision handler for bullets and monsters
// Kill the monster by removing it’s shape and body from the space as soon as it’s hit by a bullet
cpCollisionHandler *handler = cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(space, BULLET_TYPE, MONSTER_TYPE);
handler->beginFunc = begin;
```

### Contact Point Sets

Contact point sets make getting contact information simpler.

```c
cpContactPointSet cpArbiterGetContactPointSet(const cpArbiter *arb)
```

Get a contact point set struct from an arbiter.

You might do something like the following to get and process a contact point
set:

```c
cpContactPointSet set = cpArbiterGetContactPointSet(arbiter);
for(int i=0; i<set.count; i++){
    // get and work with the collision point normal and penetration distance:
    set.points[i].point
    set.points[i].normal
    set.points[i].dist
}
```

```c
void cpArbiterSetContactPointSet(cpArbiter *arb, cpContactPointSet *set)
```

Replace the contact point set of an Arbiter. You cannot change the number of
contacts, but can change the location, normal or penetration distance. The
"Sticky" demo uses this to allow objects to overlap an extra amount. You could
also use it in a Pong style game to modify the normal of the collision based on
the x-position of the collision even though the paddle is a flat shape.

### Helper Functions

```c
void cpArbiterGetShapes(cpArbiter *arb, cpShape **a, cpShape **b)
void cpArbiterGetBodies(const cpArbiter *arb, cpBody **a, cpBody **b)
```

Get the shapes (or their bodies) in the order that they were defined in the
collision handler associated with this arbiter. If you defined the handler as
`cpSpaceAddCollisionHandler(space, 1, 2, ...)`, you will find that
`a->collision_type == 1` and `b->collision_type == 2`. The convenience macro
defines and initializes the two shape variables for you. The default collision
handler doesn't use collision types so the order is undefined.

```c
#define CP_ARBITER_GET_SHAPES(arb, a, b) cpShape *a, *b; cpArbiterGetShapes(arb, &a, &b)
#define CP_ARBITER_GET_BODIES(arb, a, b) cpBody *a, *b; cpArbiterGetBodies(arb, &a, &b);
```

Shortcut macros for defining variables for and retrieving the shapes/bodies for
an arbiter.

```c
cpVect cpArbiterTotalImpulseWithFriction(cpArbiter *arb);
cpVect cpArbiterTotalImpulse(cpArbiter *arb);
```

Returns the impulse that was applied this step to resolve the collision. These
functions should only be called from a `postStep()` or `cpBodyEachArbiter()`
callback, otherwise the result is undefined. If in doubt which function to use,
use `cpArbiterTotalImpulseWithFriction()`.

```c
cpFloat cpArbiterTotalKE(const cpArbiter *arb);
```

Calculate the amount of energy lost in a collision including static, but not
dynamic friction. This function should only be called from a `postSolve()`,
`postStep()` or `cpBodyEachArbiter()` callback.

## Queries

Chipmunk spaces support four kinds of spatial queries, nearest point, segment,
shape and fast bounding box queries. Any type can be performed efficiently
against an entire space, and point and segment queries can be performed against
individual shapes. All types of queries take a collision group and layer that
are used to filter matches out using the same rules used for filtering
collisions between shapes. See [`cpShape`](#cpShape) for more information. If
you don't want to filter out any matches, use `CP_ALL_LAYERS` for the layers and
`CP_NO_GROUP` as the group.

### Nearest Point Queries

Point queries are useful for things like mouse picking and simple sensors. They
allow you to check if there are shapes within a certain distance of a point,
find the closest point on a shape to a given point or find the closest shape to
a point.

```c
typedef struct cpPointQueryInfo {
    /// The nearest shape, NULL if no shape was within range.
    const cpShape *shape;
    /// The closest point on the shape's surface. (in world space coordinates)
    cpVect point;
    /// The distance to the point. The distance is negative if the point is inside the shape.
    cpFloat distance;
    /// The gradient of the signed distance function.
    /// The value should be similar to info.p/info.d, but accurate even for very small values of info.d.
    cpVect gradient;
} cpPointQueryInfo;
```

Nearest point queries return the point on the surface of the shape as well as
the distance from the query point to the surface point.

```c
cpFloat cpShapeNearestPointQuery(cpShape *shape, cpVect p, cpPointQueryInfo *out)
```

Find the distance from `point` to `shape`. If the point is inside the shape, the
distance will be negative and equal to the depth of the point.

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceNearestPointQueryFunc)(cpShape *shape, cpFloat distance, cpVect point, void *data);

void cpSpacePointQuery(
    cpSpace *space, cpVect point, cpFloat maxDistance,
    cpShapeFilter filter,
    cpSpaceNearestPointQueryFunc func, void *data
)
```

Query `space` at `point` for shapes within the given distance range. The
`filter` is applied to the query and follows the same rules as the collision
detection. `func` is called for each shape found along with the distance to the
closest point on the shape's surface, the distance to that point and the `data`
argument passed to `cpSpaceNearestPointQuery()`. Sensor shapes are included. If
a `maxDistance` of `0.0` is used, the point must lie inside a shape. Negative
`maxDistance` is also allowed meaning that the point must be under a certain
depth within a shape to be considered a match.

```c
cpShape *cpSpacePointQueryNearest(cpSpace *space, cpVect point, cpFloat maxDistance, cpShapeFilter filter, cpPointQueryInfo *out)
```

Query `space` at `point` and return the closest shape within `maxDistance` units
of distance. `out` is an optional pointer to a `cpPointQueryInfo` if you want
additional information about the match.

### Segment Queries

Segment queries are like ray casting, but because not all spatial indexes allow
processing infinitely long ray queries it is limited to segments. In practice
this is still very fast, and you don't need to worry too much about the
performance as long as you aren't using extremely long segments for your
queries.

```c
typedef struct cpSegmentQueryInfo {
    /// The shape that was hit, or NULL if no collision occured.
    const cpShape *shape;
    /// The point of impact.
    cpVect point;
    /// The normal of the surface hit.
    cpVect normal;
    /// The normalized distance along the query segment in the range [0, 1].
    cpFloat alpha;
} cpSegmentQueryInfo;
```

Segment queries return more information than just a simple yes or no, they also
return where a shape was hit and its surface normal at the hit point. `t` is the
percentage between the query start and end points. If you need the hit point in
world space or the absolute distance from start, see the segment query helper
functions farther down. If a segment query starts within a shape it will have
`t = 0` and `n = cpvzero`.

```c
cpBool cpShapeSegmentQuery(cpShape *shape, cpVect a, cpVect b, cpFloat radius, cpSegmentQueryInfo *info)

Perform a segment query from `a` to `b` with the given `radius` against a single
shape `shape`. `info` must be a valid pointer to a `cpSegmentQueryInfo`
structure which will be initialized with the raycast info.

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceSegmentQueryFunc)(cpShape *shape, cpFloat t, cpVect n, void *data)

void cpSpaceSegmentQuery(
    cpSpace *space, cpVect start, cpVect end, cpFloat radius,
    cpShapeFilter filter,
    cpSpaceSegmentQueryFunc func, void *data
)
```

Query `space` along the line segment from `start` to `end` with the given
`radius`. The `filter` is applied to the query and follows the same rules as the
collision detection. `func` is called with the normalized distance along the
line and surface normal for each shape found along with the `data` argument
passed to `cpSpacePointQuery()`. Sensor shapes are included.

```c
cpShape *cpSpaceSegmentQueryFirst(
    cpSpace *space, cpVect start, cpVect end, cpFloat radius,
    cpShapeFilter filter,
    cpSegmentQueryInfo *info
)
```

Query `space` along the line segment from `start` to `end` with the given
`radius`. The `filter` is applied to the query and follows the same rules as the
collision detection. Only the first shape encountered is returned, and the
search is short-circuited. Returns `NULL` if no shape was found. The info struct
pointed to by `info` will be initialized with the raycast info unless `info` is
NULL. Sensor shapes are ignored.

### AABB Queries

Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) queries give you a fast way to check roughly
which shapes are in an area.

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceBBQueryFunc)(cpShape *shape, void *data)

    void cpSpaceBBQuery(
        cpSpace *space, cpBB bb,
        cpShapeFilter filter,
        cpSpaceBBQueryFunc func, void *data
    )
```

Query `space` to find all shapes near `bb`. The `filter` is applied to the query
and follows the same rules as the collision detection. `func` is called for each
shape whose bounding box overlaps `bb` along with the `data` argument passed to
`cpSpaceBBQuery()`. Sensor shapes are included.

### Shape Queries

Shape queries allow you to check if shapes in a space are overlapping a specific
area. You can use this to check if an object already exists at a location you
want to add another shape, or to use as sensor queries for AI.

You can either create a body/shape pair before querying, or you can create a
shape passing `NULL` for the body and position the shape using `cpShapeUpdate()`
to set the position and rotation of the shape.

```c
typedef void (*cpSpaceShapeQueryFunc)(cpShape *shape, cpContactPointSet *points, void *data);

cpBool cpSpaceShapeQuery(cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape, cpSpaceShapeQueryFunc func, void *data);
```

Query `space` to find all shapes overlapping `shape`. `func` is called for each
overlapping shape along with a pointer to a temporary `cpContactPointSet` and
the `data` argument passed to `cpSpaceBBQuery()`. Sensor shapes are included.

### Blocks

If your compiler supports blocks (such as Clang), there are an alternate set of
functions you can call. `cpSpaceNearestPointQuery_b()`, etc. See `chipmunk.h`
for more information.

### Query Examples

The following example is taken directly from `ChipmunkDemo.c`. When the mouse is
clicked, a point query is performed to see if there is a shape under the mouse.
If there is, it adds a joint to the body that links it to the mouse's movement.

```c
static void
click(int button, int state, int x, int y)
{
  if(button == GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON){
    if(state == GLUT_DOWN){
      cpVect point = mouseToSpace(x, y);

      cpShape *shape = cpSpacePointQueryFirst(space, point, GRABABLE_MASK_BIT, 0);
      if(shape){
        cpBody *body = shape->body;
        mouseJoint = cpPivotJointNew2(mouseBody, body, cpvzero, cpBodyWorld2Local(body, point));
        mouseJoint->maxForce = 50000.0f;
        mouseJoint->biasCoef = 0.15f;
        cpSpaceAddConstraint(space, mouseJoint);
      }
    } else if(mouseJoint){
      cpSpaceRemoveConstraint(space, mouseJoint);
      cpConstraintFree(mouseJoint);
      mouseJoint = NULL;
    }
  }
}
```

Perform a segment query to see if a laser beam hits a shape. We want to draw
particles at both the position where the beam enters and exits the shape.

```c
cpVect a = cpv(...), b = cpv(...);

cpSegmentQueryInfo info = {};
if(cpSpaceSegmentQueryFirst(space, a, b, -1, 0, &info)){
  cpSegmentQueryInfo info2;
  cpShapeSegmentQuery(info.shape, b, a, &info2);

  cpVect enterPoint = cpSegmentQueryHitPoint(a, b, info);
  cpVect exitPoint = cpSegmentQueryHitPoint(b, a, info2);
}
```
