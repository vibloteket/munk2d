# Optional AVX2 contact solver

The original contact solver remains the default. The AVX2 solver is an explicit
per-space opt-in for `cpSpaceStep()`, not a replacement for all workloads.
It uses double precision, groups independent contacts with a bounded graph
coloring, and uses four-lane SIMD. It does not add worker threads.

## Selecting a solver

```c
cpSpace *space = cpSpaceNew();
if(cpContactSolverIsAvailable(CP_CONTACT_SOLVER_AVX2)){
    if(!cpSpaceSetContactSolver(space, CP_CONTACT_SOLVER_AVX2)){
        /* Selection can fail, for example if scratch-context allocation fails. */
    }
}

/* Simulation setup and cpSpaceStep() as usual. */

/* This releases the optional solver's retained scratch allocations. */
cpSpaceSetContactSolver(space, CP_CONTACT_SOLVER_ORIGINAL);
cpSpaceFree(space);
```

`cpSpaceSetContactSolver()` returns false for an unavailable/invalid selector,
a locked space, or allocation failure, and leaves the previous selection
unchanged. Change it outside callbacks executed while the space is locked;
a post-step callback can change it. Selecting the already selected mode is
supported. Changing mode does not wake sleeping bodies, similarly to changing
the iteration count.

`cpSpaceGetContactSolver()` returns the requested mode. It does not promise that
every individual step executes SIMD. `CP_CONTACT_SOLVER_TYPE_MAX` is reserved,
not a selectable mode.

This option applies to **`cpSpaceStep()` only**. The separate
`cpHastySpaceStep()` keeps its existing solver and does not use this setting.
Using a HastySpace allocation with the normal `cpSpaceStep()` follows the normal
stepper's setting; this option is not an extension of HastySpace threading.

## Availability and fallback

The first backend supports the ordinary **double-precision x86-64 build**.
Build-time compiler capability and runtime CPU/OS capability are separate:

- CMake checks whether the actual compiler target supports the x86-64 AVX2 code.
  Unsupported targets, including ARM and 32-bit x86, keep the original solver.
- Runtime selection checks CPUID XSAVE/OSXSAVE/AVX, XGETBV XMM/YMM enablement,
  and CPUID leaf7 AVX2. XGETBV is not executed before checking OSXSAVE.
- Availability is checked when selecting the backend. As with conventional
  runtime-dispatched libraries, the process is expected to run on CPUs exposing
  a consistent supported instruction set.
- Float builds do not enable this backend. A successful compile probe alone
  does not imply that the runtime API will report availability.
- No CPU-model whitelist or performance claim is implied by AVX2 availability.

Even when requested and available, the whole step uses the original solver if:

- there are active `cpConstraint` objects (joints, springs, motors, custom types);
- fewer than four arbiters are active, or the iteration count is not positive;
- the graph cannot fit the fixed12-color budget;
- an arbiter aliases its two bodies, has an unsupported contact count, or both
  bodies have zero inverse mass and inverse inertia;
- checked scratch sizing/allocation cannot be satisfied.

Fallback decisions are made before modifying body velocities or accumulated
contact impulses. Cached/warm-start impulses retain the original phase/order.
The backend never skips a collision to make a graph fit.

## Numerical behavior and quality

Graph coloring changes the order of some dependent contact solves compared with
the original solver. Therefore trajectories, contact evolution and sleeping
behavior can differ. The algorithm remains deterministic for a fixed input,
backend, build and execution environment; identical results across solver modes,
compiler versions or hardware are not promised.

Positions, geometry, coefficients, velocities, impulse accumulators and solver
arithmetic remain double. There is no reduction of iterations or collision
quality settings and no mixed-precision path in this implementation.

Tests compare SIMD with a scalar implementation of the same ordered formulas,
check original fallback, and exercise physical diagnostics for penetration,
resting behavior, friction, restitution, center-of-mass-frame energy, momentum,
large coordinates/common velocities and mass ratios. These diagnostics are not
a universal error bound for all applications. Check your own workloads before
opting in, particularly sensitive stacks, extreme scales and configurations
with changing constraints. A passing test suite does not establish superiority
over the original solver for every quality metric.

## Build isolation

`MUNK2D_ENABLE_AVX2_CONTACT_SOLVER` defaults to ON, meaning **build the optional
backend where supported**, not select it at runtime. Disable it with:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_DEMOS=OFF \
  -DMUNK2D_ENABLE_AVX2_CONTACT_SOLVER=OFF
```

Only `cpContactSolverAvx2.c` receives the AVX2 target flags. CPU detection, API,
scheduling and allocation compile for the baseline target. The AVX2 translation
unit is excluded from cross-ISA LTO (`-fno-lto` or `/GL-`); floating-point
contraction is disabled for its formulas and the scalar reference.

For a portable binary, do not apply `-march=native`, global `-mavx2` or an
AVX-only `/arch` option to the rest of the library/application. This dispatch
cannot make such globally specialized code safe on older CPUs.

## Ownership and ABI

No fields are added to `cpSpace`, `cpBody`, `cpArbiter` or other published
structures. The allocation ledger is backed by the private
`cpSpaceBufferStorage`, whose first member is an ordinary `cpArray` and whose
additional pointer owns the optional solver context. The ordinary ledger
contents/order are unchanged; solver state is not a fake arbiter-buffer entry
and does not use application `userData` or a process-global registry.

A context is allocated only on successful opt-in. It owns separate reusable
arenas for graph metadata and solver working data. Large solver buffers are
reserved only after graph eligibility is established. Active hash length and
velocity stride depend on current work, not on retained peak capacity. No graph
coloring is cached across steps.

Preparation initializes only color/kind groups that are actually used, while
retaining the same ascending color/kind order and order within each group.
Active packet lanes are fully assigned; inactive lanes that the kernel can read
are initialized explicitly. Unused contact slots are not read. This reduces
redundant preparation work without changing solver selection or arithmetic.
Tests poison reusable working buffers to catch stale or uninitialized reads.

Arenas retain their high-water capacities until disabling the backend or
freeing the space. A grow-allocation failure preserves the previous arenas and
falls back for the current step. Destruction only frees storage: it never
commits stale body/contact references from an earlier step. Allocation/free
uses the library's existing allocator macros.

The struct definitions are private API as before. Consumers must not replace
`space->allocatedBuffers` manually or assume its owning allocation is exactly
`sizeof(cpArray)`. Normal opaque/public API usage is unaffected.

## Benchmarking

MunkBench accepts an explicit selector without changing its CSV schema or size
profiles:

```sh
./build/benchmarks/munkbench --contact-solver original --profile reference --batch auto
./build/benchmarks/munkbench --contact-solver avx2 --profile reference --batch auto
```

An unavailable AVX2 request is an error, not a mislabeled original-only run.
Per-step eligibility fallback still applies. Use alternating paired runs and
original-versus-original controls, include setup costs, and check results and
physical quality separately. Small percentage differences can be code-layout or
measurement effects. Collision-heavy workloads may benefit while others do not.

### Measured performance guidance (2.1.0)

The backend is strictly opt-in because it does not win everywhere. Measured
with MunkBench paired runs (median geometric means over 26-scenario suites,
negative = faster than the original solver):

- Wins on newer CPUs: roughly 3–4 % suite-wide on AMD Zen 4 (EPYC 9V74) and
  Intel Meteor Lake / Alder Lake (Ultra 9 185H, i5-12400T), with 20–30 % in
  contact-heavy scenes (friction pyramids, falling square piles) and additional
  gains in collision-callback and sleep/wake scenes.
- Scenes with few active contacts per step (a couple of resting or bouncing
  bodies, frictionless single-point contacts) are 5–20 % **slower** on every
  measured CPU, including Zen 4. If your typical frame has only a handful of
  contacts, keep the original solver.
- Older AVX2 Intel CPUs (Skylake-derived, e.g. i5-8265U) were a net loss before
  the gather-free loads (#58) and should be re-measured per workload.

Always measure with your own workload before enabling; treat the backend as a
targeted optimization, not a universal acceleration.

### Older AVX2 CPUs and indexed loads

The vector kernel assembles each velocity vector from four ordinary scalar
loads instead of using a hardware gather instruction. The arithmetic is still
four-lane SIMD; lane order, double values, graph scheduling and fallback decisions
are unchanged. This avoids costly gathers on older CPUs, notably Intel systems
with Gather Data Sampling (GDS) microcode mitigation. Intel documents the added
gather-result latency and recommends reducing gather use in affected workloads
in its [GDS guidance](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html).
No security mitigation needs to be disabled.

AVX2 capability alone still does not establish that this solver is faster than
the original: graph preparation, data copying, partly filled packets and
per-step fallback all cost time. Measure both modes on the actual workload and
CPU. See `benchmarks/OPTIMIZATION-LOG.md` for local measurements and limitations.
